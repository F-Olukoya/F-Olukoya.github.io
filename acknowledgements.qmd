## Webpage

This website was designed using [quarto](https://quarto.org/). The quotation style was developed with the help of [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/).

Most of the teaching resources were also developed using quarto; the resources for the dynamical systems module were produced using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/).

## Images

The logo was designed using [OpenArt Ai](https://openart.ai/home). The image to the left of the picture below is the initial sketch I provided as a prompt; to the right, after some tweaking, is the final output.
