The majority of the module will be devoted to introducing ‘Group Theory’. Groups are fundamental algebraic objects that crop up in a variety of different contexts: from crystal structures, to quantum physics and even in understanding DNA folding in biology. The following rule of thumb applies: wherever there is ‘symmetry’ there is a group. The remainder of the module will be devoted to considering other algebraic structures.",

For each assessment, you would normally not be expected to invest more than 5 hours of active-working time. An assessment schedule will be available on the Mathematics Noticeboard on the KLE. Note that the first assessment is called an assignment, whilst the second is called a coursework; this nomenclature is purely for administrative convenience.\n\n\nFormative assessment\nAt the end of each chapter in the notes, you will find problem sheets with questions addressing the content covered in that chapter. Although these sheets do not contribute to the continuous assessment component, you are strongly encouraged to attempt them as they are designed to consolidate your understanding and enhance your problem-solving skills. Full solutions are provided and will appear after the sheet or sheets have been covered in example classes.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThis comprises 70% of the module mark. It is an unseen, closed-book examination, with all questions being compulsory. The use of calculators is governed by the University regulations. The examination will require you to state definitions, state (and possibly prove) results, and apply these to solving problems. You should be able to state every definition and result in the module unless they are marked in the lecture notes as non-examinable.",

    "text": "Sets\nRecall that a set is a collection of objects which may be finite or infinite in size. For our purposes, the order of the elements of a set is irrelevant and we ignore repeated elements. For example,\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\{a,b,c,d\\} &=& \\{b,d,c,a\\} = \\ldots \\\\\n\\{a,a,c,b,a,c\\} &=&\\{a,b,c\\}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nWe use different notation for sets, depending on the size of the set and context. In addition, we shall frequently use the ‘set-builder’ notation. Some examples are:\nWe use \\(x \\in S\\) to denote that \\(x\\) is an element of the set \\(S\\) and \\(A \\subseteq S\\) to denote that \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(S\\) (so, \\(A\\) contains only a sub-collection of things that are in \\(S\\) and nothing that is not in \\(S\\) and, as a consequence, for any set \\(S\\), both \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(S\\) itself are subsets of \\(S\\)). Note that \\(A \\subset S\\) means that \\(A\\) is a proper subset of \\(S\\), that is, \\(A\\) cannot be \\(S\\) itself. Remember that if we wish to demonstrate that two sets, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) say, are equal, then it is necessary to show both that \\(X \\subseteq Y\\) and \\(Y \\subseteq X\\). If \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) are sets then we denote the set difference \\(S \\backslash T\\). This, itself, is a set and contains all of the elements that are in \\(S\\) but not in \\(T\\). So, for example, we could denote the set of non-zero integers as \\(\\Z \\backslash \\{0\\}\\) (note that this operation is defined with respect to two sets, so \\(\\Z \\backslash 0\\) would be nonsense).\nThe Cartesian product of two sets, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) say, is denoted \\(A \\times B\\) and is the set of all possible ordered pairs where the first element of the pair comes from set \\(A\\) and the second element comes from set \\(B\\). Since these are ordered pairs the order of the elements within each pair is critical, though the order in which the pairs themselves appear in \\(A \\times B\\) is irrelevant.",

If we rotate that square through an angle of \\(\\pi / 2\\) radians about its centre, then it looks exactly the same as it did before - in the absence of any labelling we cannot tell that the square has been rotated and we say that a square has rotational symmetry. We may well ask whether there are symmetries other than the aforementioned rotation that leave the square unchanged. In general we are interested in geometrical transformations that leave shapes ‘unchanged’.\nWe need to make the idea of a geometrical transformation more precise. The type of geometrical transformation that we have in mind can move a figure around, but must not change its size or shape, that is it must not alter distances or angles. In fact, a transformation which leaves distances unaltered must also leave angles unchanged, so all we need to build into our definition of a geometrical transformation is that it leaves distances unchanged. Such transformations are called symmetries.\nThe symmetries of the plane include translations, rotations about a point, and reflections in a line. For our purposes we are not concerned with symmetries that move the location of the shape in space and, hence, our attention will be restricted only to rotations and reflections.",

Conventionally rotations are measured in the anticlockwise direction.\nThus the symmetries are:\n  \\(e = r_3\\) – The identity map;\n  \\(r_1\\) – anticlockwise rotation by \\(2 \\pi/3\\) radians;\n  \\(r_2\\) – anticlockwise rotation by \\(4\\pi/3\\) radians;\n  \\(s_1\\) – reflection in the line \\(l_1\\);\n  \\(s_2\\) – reflection in the line \\(l_2\\);\n  \\(s_3\\) – reflection in the line \\(l_3\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe rotation \\(r_3\\) is a rotation of \\(6\\pi/3 = 2\\pi\\) radians is the ‘identity mapping’, in particular we can treat the rotations as working modulo \\(3\\).\n\n\nNote that as symmetries are functions, we can combine symmetries in the same way as we compose functions. In particular, when combining of symmetries we do so from right to left. We work through some examples:\n\\(r_1 \\circ s_1\\):\n  This is equal to \\(s_3\\) as shown in Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: \\(r_1 \\circ s_1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(s_2 \\circ s_3\\):\n  This is equal to \\(r_1\\) as shown in Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: \\(s_2 \\circ s_3\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(s_3 \\circ s_2\\):\nThis is equal to \\(r_2\\) (see Figure 2.4).

In particular, to find the value of \\(s_2 \\circ s_3\\) we look for the entry in row \\(s_2\\) and column \\(s_3\\) (which is \\(r_1\\)); likewise \\(s_3 \\circ s_2\\) is the entry in row \\(s_3\\) and column \\(s_2\\) (this is \\(r_2\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.2 Develop suitable notation and construct an operation table for the symmetries of a square.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Square\n\n\n\n\n\nThe symmetries are:\n  \\(r_n\\) – anticlockwise rotation by \\(2n\\pi/4 = n\\pi/2\\) radians, \\(n \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}\\);\n  \\(s_i\\) – reflection in the line \\(l_i\\), \\(i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nObserve that \\(r_0 = e\\).

    "text": "2.4 Roots of Unity\nIn the first-year Algebra module we investigated, in the complex numbers section, the roots of unity. We found that the \\(n^{th}\\) roots of unity are the \\(n\\) distinct complex numbers of the form \\(e^{i \\frac{2 k \\pi}{n}}\\) where \\(k=0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\). Consider the fifth roots of unity, that is the complex numbers of the form \\(e^{i \\frac{2 k \\pi}{5}}\\), where \\(k=0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 4\\) and let us see what happens when we multiply these together pairwise and form a table of the results.\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n\\times&1&\\e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{6\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{8\\pi i}{5}}\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&\\e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{6\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{8\\pi i}{5}}\\\\\n\\e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{6\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{8\\pi i}{5}} & 1\\\\\n\\e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{6\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{8\\pi i}{5}} & 1 & \\e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{5}} \\\\\n\\e^{\\frac{6\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{6\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{8\\pi i}{5}} & 1 &\\e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{5}}\\\\\n\\e^{\\frac{8\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{8\\pi i}{5}}& 1&\\e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{5}}&\\e^{\\frac{6\\pi i}{5}}\\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\nNote that if \\(k=5\\), then \\(\\e^{\\frac{2k\\pi i}{5}} = \\e^{2\\pi i} = 1\\).\n\nThe whole point of abstraction in Mathematics is to look at the properties of mathematical objects independently from their composition. We are interested in the general rules that govern the behaviour of particular types of object and, importantly, the generalised structure of such objects. With that in mind we now investigate the previous examples to see if there are any general properties that they all share.\n\nIn each case we started with a non-empty set of elements as follows:\n\n\nSymmetries of an equilateral triangle:\n\n\\[\\{e, r_1, r_2, s_1, s_2, s_3\\}.\\]\n\nAddition modulo 7:\n\n\\[\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}.\\]\n\nMatrices:\n\n\\[\\left\\{\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right),  \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{array} \\right), \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{array} \\right),   \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{array} \\right)\\right\\}.\\]\n\nFifth roots of unity:\n\n\\[\\left\\{1,\\e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{5}},\\e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{5}},\\e^{\\frac{6\\pi i}{5}},\\e^{\\frac{8\\pi i}{5}}\\right\\}.\\]\n\n\n\nIn each case we had an operation that we used to combine elements from the set and, more importantly gave a unique answer in each case:\n\n\nSymmetries of an Equilateral triangle:\n\nComposition of functions, for example \\[r_1 \\circ s_1 = s_3.\\]\n\nCongruences:\n\nFor a positive integer \\(m\\), addition modulo \\(m\\) (\\(\\oplus_m\\)). For example for \\(m=7\\), \\[5 \\oplus_{7} 6 = 4.\\]\n\nMatrices:\n\nMatrix multiplication. For example, \\[\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{array} \\right)\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{array} \\right)=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{array} \\right)\\]\n\nRoots of unity:\n\nMultiplication, for example \\[\\e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{5}}\\e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{5}}=\\e^{\\frac{6\\pi i}{5}}.\\]\n\n\n\n\nSuch operations are called binary operations and are defined as follows:\n\nDefinition 2.2 (Binary Operation) A binary operation on a set, \\(S\\), is an operation, \\(*\\), such that \\(x*y\\) is uniquely defined \\(\\forall x, y \\in S\\).\n\nSo, in each case we have a set of objects and a binary operation that combines elements from the set. We now turn our attention to the structure of the tables that we have constructed.\n\nThe entries in the body of the table only comprise elements of the set we are working with; the binary operation, when applied to elements of the set, never produced something not in the set. In such circumstances we say the the set is closed under the binary operation. Formally we have that a set \\(S\\) is closed under \\(*\\) if and only if \\(\\forall \\, x, y \\in S, \\; x*y \\in S\\).\n\nExample 2.4  \n\n\nSymmetries of the square: we can see from the table that composing any pair of symmetries gives another symmetry. For example \\(r_1 \\circ s_4 = s_3\\).\nCongruence: For a positive integer \\(m\\), adding two numbers modulo \\(m\\) results in a number in the set \\(\\{0,1,2,\\ldots, m-1\\}\\). For example, for \\(m=7\\), \\(3 \\oplus_7 6 = 2\\).\n\n\n\nWe can see that in each table there is one row and one column, associated with just one of the group elements, that repeats the index row and column. This tells us that each of the sets contains an identity element, that is an element that when combined under the binary operation with another element leaves that other element unchanged.\n\nWe often use the symbol \\(e\\) to represent a generic identity element and we say that the set has an identity with respect to a particular binary operation. Formally we have that \\(e \\in S\\) is an identity element of \\(S\\) with respect to \\(*\\) if and only if \\(\\forall \\, x \\in S, \\, e*x=x\\) and \\(x*e= x\\). It is important to note that the identity elements in the above examples are all ‘two-sided’.\n\nExample 2.5  \n\n\nSymmetries of the triangle:\n\nHere \\(e\\) is the identity element. We can check that, \\(e \\circ x = x \\circ e = e\\) for any symmetry \\(e\\) of the triangle. For example \\[e \\circ s_2 = s_2 \\circ e = s_2.\\]\n\nCongruences:\n\nHere, \\(0\\) is the identity element. For example, working mod \\(7\\), we can check that, \\(0 \\oplus_7 x = x \\oplus_7 0 = x\\) for any \\(x \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}\\). For example \\[0 \\oplus_{7} 5 = 5 \\oplus_{7} 0 = 5.\\]\n\nMatrices:\n\nThe identity matrix is the identity: \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\n\n\n\nAn important property of identity elements is given in the following lemma.\n\nLemma 2.1 If \\(S\\) is a set closed under a binary operation, \\(*\\), then \\(S\\) contains at most one identity.\n\n\nProof. \n\nLet \\(e\\) and \\(f\\) be identity elements of \\(S\\). Then \\(e = e \\ast f = f\\) and so \\(e = f\\).\n\n\n\nWe note that in each table the identity element appears precisely once in each row and each column. This tells us that each element of the set has a corresponding element such that when the two are combined the result is the identity. We refer to the second element as an inverse of the first.\n\n\nExample 2.6  \n\nSymmetries of the square: \\[r_1 \\circ r_3 = r_3 \\circ r_1 = e.\\]\n     Therefore \\(r_1\\) is the inverse of \\(r_3\\) and \\(r_3\\) is the inverse of \\(r_1\\).\n      Notice also that any reflection \\(s\\) is its own inverse. Since \\[s \\circ s = e\\]\n      for any reflection \\(s\\) of the square.\n\nAddition Modulo \\(7\\): \\[ 2 \\oplus_7 5 = 5 \\oplus_7 2 = 0.\\]\n      Therefore \\(5\\) is the inverse of \\(2\\) and \\(2\\) is the inverse of \\(5\\).\n\nMatrices: \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n      Therefore \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is its own inverse.\n\n\nAn important property of inverses of elements is given in the following lemma.\n\nLemma 2.2 Let \\(S\\) be a set closed under an associative binary operation, \\(*\\), with identity, \\(e\\). Then \\(x \\in S\\) has, at most, one inverse.\n\n\nProof. \n\nSuppose \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are both inverses of \\(x\\). Then\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nu\\ast x \\ast v &=& u \\ast (x\\ast v) = u \\ast e = u \\text{ and,} \\\\\nu\\ast x \\ast v &=& (u \\ast x) \\ast v = e \\ast v = v.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nTherefore \\(u = v\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you tell?\n\n\n\nCan you tell at which points in the proof above we made use of the associative property of \\(\\ast\\)?\n\n\n\n\nWe denote the inverse of an element \\(x\\) as \\(x^{-1}\\). In the same way that the identity is ‘two-sided’ we can see from the tables that the combining of each element with its inverse is two-sided and this leads to the following formal definition. Let \\(S\\) be a set, closed under a binary operation, \\(*\\), with identity \\(e\\). The inverse of \\(x \\in S\\) is any element \\(x^{-1} \\in S\\) such that \\(x*x^{-1} = x^{-1}*x = e\\).\n\nOne final property that all of our examples share, but which is not obvious from the tables, is that in each case the binary operation is associative. Formally we have that \\(*\\) is associative on \\(S\\) if and only if \\(\\forall \\, x, y, z \\in S, \\, (x*y)*z = x*(y*z)\\). Note that it is the binary operation that is associative, not the set of objects.\n\n\nExample 2.7  \n\nIn the symmetries of the triangle: One can check that for any three symmetries, \\(x,y,z\\), \\[(x \\circ y) \\circ z = x \\circ (y \\circ z)\\].\n    For example, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} (r_1 \\circ s_1)\\circ s_2 &=& s_3 \\circ s_2 = r_2 \\\\ r_1 \\circ (s_1 \\circ s_2) &=& r_1 \\circ r_1 = r_2. \\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\nIn addition modulo \\(m\\): we know that this is an associative operation.\n\n\nA set of elements, together with a binary operation that satisfies each of the conditions that we have explored above, forms an algebraic structure called a group. We shall start to deal with groups in a formal manner in the next chapter, but in the meantime we state and prove an important Lemma and explore further the properties of binary operations.\n\nLemma 2.3 Let \\(S\\) be a set closed under an associative binary operation, \\(*\\), with identity, \\(e\\). If \\(x^{-1}\\) and \\(y^{-1}\\) exist, then \\((x*y)^{-1} = y^{-1} * x^{-1}\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nSince inverses are unique, it is enough to show that \\((x \\ast y) \\ast (y^{-1} \\ast x^{-1}) = e\\) and \\((y^{-1} \\ast x^{-1}) \\ast (x \\ast y) = e\\).\nWe have: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n(x \\ast y) \\ast (y^{-1}) \\ast x^{-1}) &=& x \\ast ((y \\ast y^{-1}) \\ast x^{-1})) \\\\\n&=& x \\ast (e \\ast x^{-1}) \\\\\n&=& x \\ast x^{-1} \\\\\n&=& \\e.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nIn a similar way, one can show that \\((y^{-1} \\ast x^{-1}) \\ast (x \\ast y) = e\\).\n\n\n\nProperties of Binary Operations\n\nThe above lemma extends easily to inverses of repeated ‘products’, e.g. \\[(a*b*c*d)^{-1} = d^{-1}*c^{-1}*b^{-1}*a^{-1}.\\]\nLet \\(S\\) be a set closed under an associative binary operation, \\(*\\). Then all ways of bracketing an expression, \\(x_1*x_2* \\ldots  x_n\\), give the same answer.\nLet \\(S\\) be a set closed under an associative binary operation, \\(*\\). Then \\(x^n = \\underbrace{x*x* \\ldots *x}_{\\text{$n$ terms}}\\), where \\(n\\) is a positive integer. It follows, from the generalised associative law, that for positive integer powers of a single element, the usual index laws are valid: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n  x^a * x^b &=& x^{a+b}\\\\\n  (x^a)^b &=& x^{ab}.\n  \\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nIf \\(S\\) is a set closed under an associative binary operation, \\(*\\), with an identity element, \\(e\\), then we define \\(x^0 = e, \\;\\forall x \\in S\\).\nSince zero is not positive it now follows that the index laws are valid for all natural number powers of a single element, where \\(0 \\in \\N\\).\nIf \\(x\\) has an inverse, then we define \\[x^{-n} = (x^n)^{-1} = (x^{-1})^n,\\] where \\(n\\) is a positive integer. Note that \\((x^n)^{-1} = (x^{-1})^n\\) by repeated application of Lemma 2.3. This now ensures that the index laws are valid for all integer powers of an element which has an inverse.\n\n\nExample 2.8 A binary operation \\(*\\) is defined on \\(\\R\\) by \\(x*y=x+y-xy\\).\n\nShow that \\(\\R\\) closed under \\(*\\).\nProve that \\(*\\) associative on \\(\\R\\).\nFind the identity element w.r.t. \\(*\\) and show that it satisfies the required conditions to be an identity.\nDoes every element of \\(\\R\\) have an inverse under \\(*\\)?\n\n\n\nFor \\(x,y \\in \\R\\), \\(x \\ast y \\in \\R\\) since addition and multiplication of real numbers are closed binary operations on \\(\\R\\) In, particular as \\(x+y\\) and \\(xy\\) are real numbers, \\((x+y) -xy\\) is also a real number.\nLet \\(x,y,z \\in \\R\\), then \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n  (x \\ast y) \\ast z &=& (x+y-xy) \\ast z \\\\\n                    &=& (x+y -xy) + z - (x+y -xy)z \\\\\n                    &=& x + (y+z) - xy  - x(z - yz) - yz \\\\\n                    &=& (x + (y+z) - yz) - x( (y + z) - yz) \\\\\n                    &=& (x + (y \\ast z)) - x(y \\ast z) \\\\\n                    &=& x \\ast (y \\ast z).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nLet \\(e \\in \\R\\) be the identity element under \\(\\ast\\), then \\[\\begin{eqnarray}\nx = e \\ast x &=& e + x - ex\n    \\end{eqnarray}\\] Solving this equation, we find that: \\(e(1-x) = 0\\). Thus, as this must hold for all \\(x \\in \\R\\), in particular, for \\(x \\ne 1\\), we find that \\(e = 0\\). We now check that \\(0 \\ast x = x = x \\ast 0\\) for all \\(x \\in \\R\\). \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n   0 \\ast x &=& 0 + x -0x = x\\\\\n   x \\ast 0 &=& x + 0 - x0 = x.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] Therefore \\(0\\) is the identity element with respect to \\(\\ast\\).\nLet \\(x \\in \\R\\) and suppose \\(y \\in \\R\\) is the inverse of \\(x\\). Then \\[0 = x \\ast y = x + y - xy.\\] It follows that \\(y(1-x) = -x\\). Thus \\(y\\) must be \\(\\frac{x}{x-1}\\). This is only defined for \\(x \\ne 1\\). Hence every element of \\(\\R\\) other than \\(1\\) has an inverse under \\(\\ast\\). Notice that \\(1 \\ast x = x \\ast 1 = 1\\) for all \\(x \\in \\R\\).",

Hence \\(P(1)\\) is true.\nWe now assume the proposition is true for some \\(n=k\\), say, that is \\[(x_1 * x_2 * \\ldots * x_{k-1} * x_k)^{-1} = x_k^{-1} * x_{k-1}^{-1} * \\ldots * x_2^{-1} * x_1^{-1}.\\] This is our induction hypothesis.\nThen, for \\(n=k+1\\) we have\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n(x_1 * x_2 * \\ldots * x_{k} * x_{k+1})^{-1} &=& ((x_1 * x_2 * \\ldots * x_{k-1} * x_k) * x_{k+1})^{-1} \\hspace{0.3cm} \\text{associativity}\\\\\n&=& x_{k+1}^{-1} * (x_1 * x_2 * \\ldots * x_{k-1} * x_k)^{-1} \\hspace{0.6cm} \\text{Lemma 2.3}\\\\\n&=& x_{k+1}^{-1} * x_k^{-1} *  \\ldots * x_2^{-1} * x_1^{-1} \\hspace{1.9cm} \\text{I.H.}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nSo, \\(P(1)\\) is true and if \\(P(k)\\) is true then \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. Hence, by induction, the statement is true for all \\(n \\in \\N\\). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2.3\n\n\nA binary operation \\(*\\) is defined on \\(\\R\\) by \\(x*y=xy-2x-2y+6\\).\n\nIs \\(\\R\\) closed under \\(*\\)?\nIs \\(*\\) associative on \\(\\R\\)?\nDoes \\(\\R\\) have an identity element w.r.t. \\(*\\)?\nDoes every element of \\(\\R\\) have an inverse under \\(*\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 2.3\n\n\n\n\nSolution 2.3\n\n\n\nFor closure we will need to show that \\(\\forall \\,x,y \\in\n\\R\\), then \\(x*y \\in \\R\\). We need to use the following facts\n\nif \\(a, b \\in \\R\\), then \\(a+b \\in \\R\\)\nif \\(a, b \\in \\R\\), then \\(ab \\in \\R\\)\n\\(a \\in \\R\\), then \\(-a \\in \\R\\)\n\nSo, \\(x*y \\,= \\, xy + (-2x) + (-2y) +6 \\in \\R\\) by the above.\nFor associativity we need to show that \\(\\forall \\, x, y,z \\in \\R\\), then \\(x*(y*z) = (x*y)*z\\). Now \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nx*(y*z) &=& x*(yz-2y-2z+6) \\\\\n        &=& x(yz-2y-2z+6) -2x -2(yz-2y-2z+6) +6 \\\\\n        &=& xyz-2xy-2xz+6x-2x-2yz+4y+4z-12+6 \\\\\n        &=& xyz-2xy-2xz-2yz+4x+4y+6z-2z-12+6\\\\\n        &=& xyz-2xz-2yz+6z-2xy+4x+4y-12-2z+6 \\\\\n        &=& (xy-2x-2y+6)*z \\\\\n        &=& (x*y)*z.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] The other way to approach this is to compute \\(x*(y*z)\\) and \\((x*y)*z\\) and show that they produce the same result.\nIdentity: we need to show that \\(\\exists \\, e \\in \\R\\) such that \\(\\forall \\,x \\in \\R\\),; \\(x * \\,e \\, = \\,e *\\,x \\,= \\,x\\). Now, \\(x*e = xe-2x-2e+6\\) and \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n      xe-2x-2e+6 = x &\\Leftrightarrow& xe-2e = 3x-6 \\\\\n             &\\Leftrightarrow& e(x-2) = 3(x-2)\n      \\end{eqnarray*}\\] and similarly for \\(e * x = x\\). Notice that this is satisfied when \\(e = 3\\) or when \\(x = 2\\). If \\(x=2\\) then we have \\(2*3 = (2 \\times 3)-4-6+6 = 2\\) (and, similarly, \\(3*2=2\\)). Hence, for this binary operation, \\(\\R\\) does have an identity element which is 3.\nInverse: we need to show that \\(\\forall \\,x \\in \\R\\),\\(\\exists \\, x^{-1} \\in \\R\\) such that \\(x * \\,x^{-1} \\, = \\,x^{-1} *\\,x \\,= \\,3\\), where, from the above, \\(e = 3\\).\nSo, consider \\(x * x^{-1} \\,= \\,3\\). Now \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nx * x^{-1} = 3 &\\Leftrightarrow& x x^{-1} -2x -2x^{-1} +6= 3 \\\\\n               &\\Leftrightarrow& x^{-1} (x-2) = 2x-3\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] and similarly for \\(x^{-1} * x = 3\\). Clearly this is satisfied whenever \\(x\\) does not equal 2. Then, for \\(x \\neq 2\\) we have that \\(x^{-1} = \\frac{2x-3}{x-2}\\). Note that if \\(x=2\\) then this gives \\(0=1\\), hence \\(2^{-1}\\) does not exist. So, all elements of \\(\\R\\) except 2 have an inverse.\n\nThere is an important point to be made here in regard to binary operations. Do not, in the above, be fooled into putting \\(e\\) in place of \\(xx^{-1}\\). The binary operation there was normal multiplication in \\(\\R\\) and not \\(*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2.4\n\n\nA binary operation \\(*\\) is defined on \\(\\R\\backslash\\{2\\}\\) by \\(x*y=xy-2x-2y+6\\).\n\nIs \\(\\R\\backslash\\{2\\}\\) closed under \\(*\\)?\nIs \\(*\\) associative on \\(\\R\\backslash\\{2\\}\\)?\nDoes \\(\\R\\backslash\\{2\\}\\) have an identity element w.r.t. \\(*\\)?\nDoes every element of \\(\\R\\backslash\\{2\\}\\) have an inverse under \\(*\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 2.4\n\n\n\n\nSolution 2.4\n\n\nWe know from Question 2.3 that ii. iii. and iv. are true. We therefore only need to show i. We prove this by contradiction.\nAssume that there exist \\(x, y \\in \\R \\backslash \\{2\\}\\) such that \\(x*y=2\\). Then, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nx*y &=& 2\\\\\n\\ifif \\qquad xy-2x-2y+6 &=& 2\\\\\n\\ifif \\qquad x(y-2) &=& 2y-4\\\\\n\\ifif \\qquad x &=& \\frac{2(y-2)}{y-2}, \\quad y \\neq 2\\\\\n\\ifif \\qquad x &=& 2\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nBut \\(x \\neq 2\\) (and, similarly, neither does \\(y\\)) and so closure is not violated.\nHence, \\((\\R \\backslash \\{2\\}, *)\\) forms a group.",

Then \\(e_H \\times e_H = e_H\\). Now since \\(H \\subseteq G\\), it follows that \\(e_H \\in G\\) and so \\(e_H\\) has an inverse in \\(G\\). We find \\[(e_H)^{-1} \\times e_H \\times e_{H} = (e_H)^{-1} \\times e_{H},\\] and so \\[e_H = e_G \\times e_{H} = e_G = (e_H)^{-1} \\times e_{H}.\\] Therefore \\(e_G = e_H\\) as required.\nLet \\(h \\in H\\). Let \\(g\\) be the inverse of \\(h\\) in \\(H\\). Then \\(g \\times h= e_H = e_G\\). It follows by Corollary 3.1 that \\(g = h^{-1}\\) the inverse of \\(h\\) in \\(G\\).\n\n\n\nIn order to determine whether a given subset of the elements of a group forms a subgroup, we could check all of the group axioms in Definition 2.3. The following lemma states that this is not necessary, in particular associativity is ‘inherited’.\n\nLemma 3.4 (Subgroup Test) Let \\(H\\) be a non-empty subset of the elements of a group \\(\\gx\\). Then \\(\\hx\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\gx\\) if and only if , \\(\\forall \\, h_1, h_2 \\in H\\)\n\n\\(h_1 \\times h_2 \\in H\\) (i.e. \\(H\\) is closed under \\(\\times\\)),\n\\(h_1^{-1} \\in H\\) (i.e. \\(H\\) is closed under inverse).\n\n\n\nProof. \n\nIf \\(H\\) is a subgroup then i. and ii. follow from the fact that \\((H,\\times)\\) is a group.\nFor the reverse implication, assume \\((H, \\times)\\) satisfies i. and ii. We show that \\(\\hx\\) satisfies the group axioms (Definition 3.1). The closure and inverse axioms are assumed to hold (they are points i. and ii. above). We only need show that \\(\\times\\) is an associative binary operation on \\(H\\) and \\(H\\) contains an identity.\n\nAssociativity:\n\nLet \\(h_1, h_2, h_3 \\in H\\), then \\((h_1 \\times h_2) \\times h_3 = h_1 \\times (h_2 \\times h_3)\\) since \\(\\times\\) is an associative binary operation on \\(G\\) and \\(h_1,h_2,h_3\\) are also elements of \\(G\\).\n\nIdentity:\n\nLet \\(h \\in H\\), then by assumption \\(h^{-1} \\in H\\). It follows that \\(e_G = h \\times h^{-1} \\in H\\) since \\(H\\) is closed under products.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.6 \\((\\Q \\backslash \\{ 0 \\}, \\times)\\) is a subgroup of \\((\\R \\backslash \\{ 0 \\}, \\times)\\).\n\nSolution:\nWe apply the subgroup test.\nWe first observe that \\(\\Q\\backslash\\{0\\}\\) is a non-empty subset of \\(\\R\\).\n\nWe note that the product of two rational numbers is again a rational number.\nLet \\(a = p/q \\in \\Q\\backslash\\{0\\}\\). Then \\(p \\ne 0 \\ne q\\) and so \\(b= q/p \\in \\Q\\backslash\\{0\\}\\). Moreover, \\(ab = ba = 1\\) and so \\((\\Q \\backslash \\{ 0 \\}, \\times)\\) is closed under inverses.\n\nTherefore, \\((\\Q \\backslash \\{ 0 \\}, \\times)\\) is a subgroup of \\((\\R \\backslash \\{ 0 \\}, \\times)\\).\n\n\n\nExample 3.7 Show that the set \\(M=\\left\\{\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}a&b\\\\-b&a\\end{array}\\right)\\in\\R_{2\\times 2}\\,| \\,a,b\\mbox{ not both zero}\\right\\}\\), forms a subgroup of GL\\((2,\\R)\\) under matrix multiplication.\n\nSolution:\nWe again apply Lemma 3.4. We observe that \\(M\\) is non-empty since it contains the identity matrix (\\(a=1,b=0\\)) \\[I_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\nLet \\(a,b,c,d \\in \\R\\) such that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not both zero and \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are not both zero. Let \\[A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b & a \\end{pmatrix}\\] and \\[C = \\begin{pmatrix} c & d \\\\ -d & c \\end{pmatrix}\\] and consider the product \\[AC=\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b & a \\end{pmatrix}  \\begin{pmatrix} c & d \\\\ -d & c \\end{pmatrix} =  \\begin{pmatrix} ac -bd & ad + bc \\\\ -(ad + bc) & ac - bd \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\nNow, \\(AC \\in M\\) precisely if \\((ac-bd)\\) and \\((ad + bc)\\) are not both zero. Suppose for a contradiction that \\(ac=bd\\) and \\(ad=-bc\\). We have: \\[a(ad + bc) = a^2d + bac = a^2d +  b^2 d = d(a^2 + b^2) = 0\\] and \\[b(ad+ bc) = abd + b^2 c = a^2 c + b^2 c = c(a^2 +b^2) = 0.\\] Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not both zero, then \\(a^2 + b^2\\) is not equal to \\(0\\). This means that both \\(d\\) and \\(c\\) must be zero. Which is a contradiction. Therefore \\(ac-bd\\) and \\(ab+bc\\) are not both zero.\nLet \\[A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b & a \\end{pmatrix} \\in M.\\] Observe that \\(\\det(A) = a^2 + b^2 \\ne 0\\) since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not both zero. Therefore, the matrix \\[A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}\\begin{pmatrix} a & -b \\\\ b & a \\end{pmatrix}\\] is such that \\(AA^{-1} = I_2 = A^{-1}A\\). Moreover, \\(A^{-1} \\in M\\) since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not both zero.\n\n\n\nIt is even easier to check whether a finite subset of the elements of a group forms a subgroup.\n\nLemma 3.5 (Finite Subgroups) Let \\(H\\) be a non-empty, finite subset of the elements of a group \\(\\gx\\). Then \\(\\hx\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\gx\\) if and only if \\(H\\) is closed under \\(\\times\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nIf \\(\\hx\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\gx\\), then \\(H\\) is closed under \\(\\times\\).\nNow assume that \\(H\\) is closed under \\(\\times\\). We use Lemma 3.4 again. Part i. is assumed.\nLet \\(h \\in H\\) and consider the set \\(\\{h^{i}: i \\in \\N\\}\\). By assumption that \\(H\\) is closed under \\(\\times\\), we observe that \\(\\{h^{i}: i \\in \\N\\} \\subseteq H\\). However since \\(H\\) is finite, it must be the case that \\(\\{h^{i}: i \\in \\N\\}\\) is finite as well. Therefore there is \\(i,j \\in \\N\\), such that \\(j &gt;i\\) and \\(h^{i} = h^{j}\\). Since \\(j &gt;i\\) then \\(h^{j} = h^{i}h^{j-i}\\). Therefore \\(h^{i} = h^{i}h^{j-i}\\). Applying the Cancellation Laws, we conclude that \\(e = h^{j-i}\\). Therefore \\(h h^{j-i-1} = e\\). It follows that \\(h^{-1}= h^{j-i-1}\\). Since \\(h^{j-i-1} \\in H\\), it follows that \\(H\\) is closed under inverses.\n\n\n\nExample 3.8 \\((\\{ 1, -1, i, -i \\}, \\times)\\) is a subgroup of \\((\\C \\backslash \\{ 0\\}, \\times)\\).\n\nSolution: The set \\(\\{ 1, -1, i, -i \\}\\) is a finite subset of \\(\\C\\) and so we use Lemma 3.5. The easiest thing to do here is to write out the multiplication table; so long as only elements from \\(\\{ 1, -1, i, -i \\}\\) appear in the table, then \\((\\{ 1, -1, i, -i \\}, \\times)\\) is closed under multiplication and is a subgroup of \\((\\C, \\times)\\). \\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\times&1&-1&i&-i\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&-1&i&-i\\\\\n-1&-1&-i&i&i\\\\\ni&i&-i&-1&1\\\\\n-i&-i&i&1&-1\n\\end{array}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nIt follows that \\((\\{ 1, -1, i, -i \\}, \\times)\\) is a subgroup of \\((\\C, \\times)\\).\n\n\n\nExample 3.9 Consider the set \\(H = \\{ 2^n \\, | \\, n \\in \\N\\} = \\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \\ldots \\}\\). Then \\((H,\\times)\\) is not a subgroup of \\((\\Q\\backslash\\{0\\},\\times)\\) even though \\(H \\subsetneq \\Q \\backslash\\{0\\}\\) is non-empty and closed under \\(\\times\\).\n\nSolution: That \\((H,\\times)\\) is not a subgroup of \\((\\Q\\backslash\\{0\\},\\times)\\) can be seen by observing that it is not closed under inverses. For instance the inverse of \\(2\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\not\\in H\\); \\(H\\) is however closed under products: for \\(n,m \\in \\N\\), \\[2^n \\times 2^m = 2^{m+n} \\in H.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThis example illustrates that Lemma 3.5 really only works for showing that a finite subset of a group is a subgroup, for infinite subsets of a group, Lemma 3.4 is the lemma to use. If in doubt then use Lemma 3.4.\n\n\nNow consider the set \\(I = \\{2^{n}: n \\in \\Z\\}\\) (notice that \\(I\\) extends \\(H\\) to include negative powers of \\(2\\)), \\((I, \\times)\\) is a subgroup of \\((\\Q\\backslash\\{0\\},\\times)\\). We have to use Lemma 3.4 to demonstrate this since \\(I\\) is an infinite set. i. Let \\(m,n \\in \\Z\\), then \\(2^{m},2^{n} \\in I\\) and \\(2^{m}\\times 2^{n} = 2^{m+n} \\in I\\). Therefore, \\(I\\) is closed under products. ii. Let \\(2^{m} \\in I\\), then \\(2^{-m} \\in I\\), since \\(-m \\in \\Z\\). Moreover, \\(2^{m}2^{-m} = 1\\). Therefore, \\(I\\) is closed under inverses.\nThus the set of all integer powers of \\(2\\) forms a subgroup of \\((\\Q\\backslash\\{0\\},\\times)\\). One might wonder if set of integral powers of an arbitrary element of a group more generally forms a subgroup under the group multiplication. This is the next result.\n\n\n\nTheorem 3.1 (Cyclic Subgroup) Let \\(\\gx\\) be a group and \\(a \\in G\\). Then \\((\\{ a^n \\, | \\, n \\in \\Z\\},\\times)\\) forms a subgroup of \\(\\gx\\) called the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted \\(\\langle a \\rangle\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nNote that the set \\(H=\\{ a^n \\, | \\, n \\in \\Z\\}\\) can be finite or infinite and we have seen examples of both (see Example 3.3 (a) for instance). Therefore Lemma 3.4 is what we have to use here. We begin as always by observing that \\(H\\) is non-empty since it contains both \\(e= a^{0}\\) and \\(a = a^{1}\\).\n\nLet \\(a^m, a^n \\in H\\), then \\(a^{m} \\times a^{n} = a^{m+n} \\in H\\) since \\(m+n \\in \\Z\\). Therefore \\((H, \\times)\\) is closed under products.\nLet \\(a^{m} \\in H\\), then \\(a^{-m} \\in H\\) since \\(-m \\in \\Z\\). Moreover, \\(a^{m}a^{-m} = a^{0}= e\\). Therefore \\(\\hx\\) is closed under inverses.\n\nWe conclude that \\(\\hx = (\\{ a^n \\, | \\, n \\in \\Z\\},\\times)\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\gx\\).\n\n\n\n\nIn the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle:\n\nWhat are the elements of \\(\\langle r_1 \\rangle\\)?\n\n\\(\\langle r_1 \\rangle=\\{e,r_1,r_2\\}\\).\n\nWhat are the elements of \\(\\langle s_1 \\rangle\\)?\n\n\\(\\langle s_1 \\rangle = \\{e,s_1\\}\\).\n\n\nIn \\((\\R, +)\\):\n\nWhat are the elements of \\(\\langle 1 \\rangle\\)?.\n\n\\(\\langle 1 \\rangle = \\Z\\).\n\nWhat are the elements of \\(\\langle 2 \\rangle\\)?\n\n\\(\\langle 2 \\rangle = 2\\Z = \\{2m : m \\in \\Z\\}\\).\n\n\nIn \\((\\R \\backslash \\{0\\}, \\times)\\):\n\nWhat are the elements of \\(\\langle 1 \\rangle\\)?\n\n\\(\\langle 1 \\rangle = \\{1\\}\\).\n\nWhat are the elements of \\(\\langle 2 \\rangle\\)?\n\n\\(\\langle 2 \\rangle = \\{2^{n}: n \\in \\Z\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 3.6 (Cyclic Generator) A group, \\(G\\), is called cyclic if and only if there exists an element \\(a \\in G\\), called a generator of \\(G\\), such that \\(G = \\langle a \\rangle\\).\n\n\nExample 3.10 (Positive and Negative Examples)  \n\n\\((\\Z, +)\\) is cyclic.

We call this \\(\\Z_n\\). Is it a group? Is it cyclic?\nIn proving the next theorem we will use the following ‘obvious’ fact (shown in Algebra).\n\nFor a given non-zero integer \\(n\\), any integer \\(k\\) can be written in the form \\(k = qn + r\\), where \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) are integers and \\(0 \\leq r &lt; |n|\\).\n\n\nTheorem 3.2 Let \\(\\gx\\) be a cyclic group with generator \\(a\\). Then \\(|G| =\\) period of \\(a\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\ncase (a):\n\nHere we assume that \\(a\\) has infinite period. In this case it is clear that the group \\(G\\) is also infinite. For \\(G=\\{a^{n}: n \\in \\Z\\}\\) and if \\(a^{n} = a^{m}\\), then \\(a^{n}\\times a^{-m} = a^{n-m} = e\\) and so \\(n=m =e\\) (since \\(a\\) has infinite order).\n\ncase (b):\n\nHere we assume that \\(a\\) has finite order \\(n\\). In order to show that \\(|G| = n\\), we have to show that for any \\(k \\in \\Z\\), there is an \\(r \\in \\N\\) such that \\(0 \\le r \\le n-1\\) and \\(a^{k} = a^{r}\\). We then also need to show that for integers \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) satisfying \\(0 \\le r,s \\le n-1\\), \\(a^{r} = a^{s}\\) if and only if \\(r=s\\).\nFor the first let \\(k \\in \\Z\\) be arbitrary. Using the fact from Algebra, there are \\(q, r \\in \\Z\\) with \\(0 \\le r \\le n-1\\) such that \\(k = qn + r\\).

    "text": "3.3 Problem Sheet 3\nFor Week 4; covers Chapter 3.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.1\n\n\nDecide whether or not the following are groups:\n\nthe set \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\) with operation \\(*\\) defined by the following operation table \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n*&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n\\hline\n1&2&1&5&3&4\\\\\n2&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n3&4&3&2&5&1\\\\\n4&5&4&1&2&3\\\\\n5&3&5&4&1&2\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nthe power set of a non-empty set \\(A\\), with respect to set intersection;\nthe set \\(S = \\{a, b, c, d, e, f\\}\\) consisting of the six functions defined by \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}  \n    &a(x)=x, \\;& b(x) = 1-x, \\; c(x) = \\frac{1}{x}, \\\\ &d(x) = \\frac{x-1}{x}, \\;& e(x) = \\frac{x}{x-1}, \\; f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x},\n    \\end{eqnarray*}\\] together with the binary operation of function composition. Draw up an operation table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 3.1\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.1\n\n\n\nClearly \\(S\\) is closed under \\(*\\) as only elements of \\(S\\) appear in the body of the table. 2 is the identity, since row 2 and column 2 are the same as the index row and column. Furthermore, every element must have an inverse in the set since the identity (i.e. 2) appears exactly once in each row and each column. So, is the binary operation associative? Consider, for example, the following: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n(3*4)*1 &=& 5*1 \\;\\; = \\;\\; 3\\\\\n3*(4*1) &=& 3*5 \\;\\; = \\;\\; 1\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] Hence the binary operation is not associative, so \\((S, *)\\) is not a group.\nRecall that the power set of a non-empty set, \\(A\\) say, is the set of all subsets of \\(A\\). So, for example, the power set of \\(S\\) in the question above is \\[\\mathcal{P}(S) = \\{ \\emptyset, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\ldots, \\{1,2\\}, \\ldots, \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}, S\\}\\] We now need to examine each of the group axioms in turn.\n\nClosure:\nquite clearly, each of the subsets of \\(A\\) can only contain elements of \\(A\\). As the intersection of any two subsets of \\(A\\) must result in another subset of \\(A\\) and since \\(\\mathcal{P}(A)\\) contains all of the subsets of \\(A\\), then \\(A\\) must be closed under set intersection.\nAssociativity:\nset intersection is an associative operation (see Algebra).\nIdentity:\nWe need a subset of \\(A\\) (that is, an element of \\(\\mathcal{P}(A))\\), let’s call it \\(I\\) such that, for any subset of \\(A\\), say \\(X\\), \\[X \\cap I = I \\cap X = X.\\] The only subset of \\(A\\) (and, hence, element of \\(\\mathcal{P}(A))\\) that satisfies this condition is \\(A\\) itself, so \\(A\\) is the identity with respect to set intersection. For an example of how this works, consider the set \\(S\\) in part (i) above. Consider an element of \\(\\mathcal{P}(S)\\), lets say \\(\\{1, 3, 4\\}\\). Clearly, if we intersect this with \\(S\\) itself we get \\[\\{1, 3, 4\\} \\cap \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} \\cap \\{1, 3, 4\\} = \\{1, 3, 4\\}.\\]\nInverse: given that the identity, \\(I\\), is the set \\(A\\) itself, we need to ask whether or not every subset of \\(A\\), that is \\(X \\in \\mathcal{P}(A)\\) has an inverse, \\(X^{-1}\\) such that \\[X \\cap X^{-1} = X^{-1} \\cap X = I = A\\] A moments thought should tell you that the only element of \\(\\mathcal{P}(A)\\) that satisfies this condition is \\(A\\) itself and, hence, not every element of \\(\\mathcal{P}(A)\\) has an inverse in \\(\\mathcal{P}(A)\\).\n\nSo, this does not form a group.\nHere we have a set of real-valued functions under function composition. It is important to remember how we compose functions. If \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are functions then we denote \\(f\\) acting on \\(g\\) as \\(f \\circ g\\) (a function in itself), taking special note of the fact that, when applied to an argument, \\(g\\) acts before \\(x\\). So, \\((f \\circ g) (x) = f(g(x))\\). The easiest way, in this case, to check for closure is to draw up an operation table. here are a few worked examples:\n\n\\(\\quad (a \\circ c)(x) = a(c(x)) = a\\left(\\D\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\D\\frac{1}{x} = c(x)\\). This should come as no surprise as \\(a\\) is clearly the identity function. So, the first stage of completing the table is easy: \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n\\circ&a&b&c&d&e&f\\\\\n\\hline\na&a&b&c&d&e&f\\\\\nb&b\\\\\nc&c\\\\\nd&d\\\\\ne&e\\\\\nf&f\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\\(\\quad (b \\circ b)(x) = b(b(x)) = b(1-x) = 1-(1-x) = x = a(x)\\). So, \\(b\\) is self-inverse.\n\\(\\quad (d \\circ e)(x) = d(e(x)) = d\\left(\\D\\frac{x}{x-1}\\right) = \\D\\frac{\\frac{x}{x-1} - 1}{\\frac{x}{x-1}} = \\D\\frac{\\frac{1}{x-1}}{\\frac{x}{x-1}} = \\D\\frac{1}{x} = c(x).\\)\n\nCarrying on in a similar manner we can complete the table as follows: \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n\\circ&a&b&c&d&e&f\\\\\n\\hline\na&a&b&c&d&e&f\\\\\nb&b&a&d&c&f&e\\\\\nc&c&f&a&e&d&b\\\\\nd&d&e&b&f&c&a\\\\\ne&e&d&f&b&a&c\\\\\nf&f&c&e&a&b&d\n\\end{array}\n\\] (You should try some more examples yourselves until you are confident with how to combine the functions). It is now clear that the set is closed under function composition since the body of the table contains no elements that are not in the set \\(S\\). We know that function composition is an associative operation and it has already been said that there is clearly an identity element, namely \\(a\\). Finally, as the identity appears exactly once in each row and column, we know that each element of the set has an inverse. Hence we can conclude that \\((S, \\circ)\\) is a group. It may not have escaped your notice that the ‘structure’ of the table is the same as the ‘structure’ of the operation table for \\(D_3\\), the symmetries of an equilateral triangle (what do we mean by that?). This is no coincidence, as we shall see later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.2\n\n\nLet \\(G\\) be the symmetry group of a regular hexagon. Using the Cayley table below\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline \\circ&e&r_1&r_2&r_3&r_4&r_5& s_1&s_2&s_3&s_4&s_5&s_6\\\\\n\\hline\\hline\ne&e&r_1&r_2&r_3&r_4&r_5& s_1&s_2&s_3&s_4&s_5&s_6\\\\\nr_1&r_1&r_2&r_3&r_4&r_5&e&s_6&s_1&s_2&s_3&s_4&s_5\\\\\nr_2&r_2&r_3&r_4&r_5&e&r_1&s_5&s_6&s_1&s_2&s_3&s_4\\\\\nr_3&r_3&r_4&r_5&e&r_1&r_2&s_4&s_5&s_6&s_1&s_2&s_3\\\\\nr_4&r_4&r_5&e&r_1&r_2&r_3&s_3&s_4&s_5&s_6&s_1&s_2\\\\\nr_5&r_5&e&r_1&r_2&r_3&r_4&s_2&s_3&s_4&s_5&s_6&s_1\\\\\ns_1&s_1&s_2&s_3&s_4&s_5&s_6&e&r_1&r_2&r_3&r_4&r_5\\\\\ns_2&s_2&s_3&s_4&s_5&s_6&s_1&r_5&e&r_1&r_2&r_3&r_4\\\\\ns_3&s_3&s_4&s_5&s_6&s_1&s_2&r_4&r_5&e&r_1&r_2&r_3\\\\\ns_4&s_4&s_5&s_6&s_1&s_2&s_3&r_3&r_4&r_5&e&r_1&r_2\\\\\ns_5&s_5&s_6&s_1&s_2&s_3&s_4&r_2&r_3&r_4&r_5&e&r_1\\\\\ns_6&s_6&s_1&s_2&s_3&s_4&s_5&r_1&r_2&r_3&r_4&r_5&e\\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nfind\n\na subgroup of order 2,\na subgroup of order 3,\na subgroup of order 4, and\na subgroup of order 6.\n\nDoes \\(G\\) contain any subgroups which are not of order 2, 3, 4 or 6?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 3.2\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.2\n\n\nThe subgroups are given, in Cayley table form, below.

There is one more; make sure you can spot it.\nthere is only one subgroup of order 3 which is \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\circ&e&r_2&r_4\\\\\n\\hline\ne&e&r_2&r_4\\\\\nr_2&r_2&r_4&e\\\\\nr_4&r_4&e&r_2\n\\end{array}\n\\]\none subgroup of order 4 is \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\circ&e&r_3&s_2&s_5\\\\\n\\hline\ne&e&r_3&s_2&s_5\\\\\nr_3&r_3&e&s_5&s_2\\\\\ns_2&s_2&s_5&e&r_3\\\\\ns_5&s_5&s_2&r_3&e\n\\end{array}\n\\] Any more? Note that this is an abelian subgroup of an non-abelian group.\nthe obvious subgroup of order 6 is \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n\\circ&e&r_1&r_2&r_3&r_4&r_5\\\\\n\\hline\ne&e&r_1&r_2&r_3&r_4&r_5\\\\\nr_1&r_1&r_2&r_3&r_4&r_5&e\\\\\nr_2&r_2&r_3&r_4&r_5&e&r_1\\\\\nr_3&r_3&r_4&r_5&e&r_1&r_2\\\\\nr_4&r_4&r_5&e&r_1&r_2&r_3\\\\\nr_5&r_5&e&r_1&r_2&r_3&r_4\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is ‘Yes’. The trivial subgroup \\((\\{ e \\}), \\circ)\\) has order 1 and the improper subgroup, that is the group itself, has order 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.3\n\n\nFor the sets \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\) and \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\) construct operation tables under multiplication modulo 5 and multiplication modulo 6, respectively.\nDo either of these form groups? Make a general conjecture concerning \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}\\) under multiplication modulo \\(n\\).\nNow repeat the process with \\(0\\) removed from each set. How does this affect the result. Make a further general conjecture concerning \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}\\) under multiplication modulo \\(n\\) (you may need to try a few more examples to back up your idea – it’s not immediately obvious what is going on).\nFor those instances that still do not form groups, can you generate a group by removing further elements from the set. If so, which ones? Is there a pattern? Try different examples of your own until you can make a further general conjecture.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 3.3\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.3\n\n\nThe tables are \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n\\otimes_5&0&1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&0&0&0&0\\\\\n1&0&1&2&3&4\\\\\n2&0&2&4&1&3\\\\\n3&0&3&1&4&2\\\\\n4&0&4&3&2&1\n\\end{array}\n\\] and \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}\n\\otimes_6&0&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&0&0&0&0&0\\\\\n1&0&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n2&0&2&4&0&2&4\\\\\n3&0&3&0&3&0&3\\\\\n4&0&4&2&0&4&2\\\\\n5&0&5&4&3&2&1\n\\end{array}.\n\\]\nA cursory glance at the tables reveals that these systems cannot be groups since in neither case does zero have an inverse in the set (but we know this generally where we have 0 in a set and the operation is multiplication of numbers). So what happens if we remove 0 from the set? The operation tables then become:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\otimes_5&1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&2&3&4\\\\\n2&2&4&1&3\\\\\n3&3&1&4&2\\\\\n4&4&3&2&1\n\\end{array}\n\\] and \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n\\otimes_6&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n2&2&4&0&2&4\\\\\n3&3&0&3&0&3\\\\\n4&4&2&0&4&2\\\\\n5&5&4&3&2&1\n\\end{array}.\n\\]\nIn the first case the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\) now forms a group under multiplication modulo 5 (check it). In the second case, though, we still do not have a group since the set is clearly not closed under the operation. So, can we make a general conjecture about the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}\\) under multiplication modulo \\(n\\)? If you try a few more cases it soon becomes obvious that when \\(n\\) is prime the removal of 0 from the set is sufficient for the system to then form a group. But what about the case where \\(n\\) is not prime? Well, notice that in removing the 0 from the set where \\(n\\) is prime is equivalent to removing the only element that does not have an inverse in the set. Now, in the second case, none of 0, 2, 3, 4 have inverses in the set, so what happens if we remove these elements? We get the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n\\otimes_6&1&5\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&5\\\\\n5&5&1\n\\end{array}.\n\\] This is now a group.\nWe now conjecture that removing from the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}\\) all of the elements which do not have inverses in the set, under multiplication modulo \\(n\\), yields a group. In fact this is true for all \\(n\\) (you may wish to try this for \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 7\\}\\) under multiplication modulo 8). So, what is the relationship between the elements removed and the value of \\(n\\)? From the examples so far it seems clear that we always have to remove 0, but never 1. Why should this be? The answer (if you haven’t figured it out) will come in Chapter 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.4\n\n\nGiving a suitable notation, draw up the operation table for the symmetries of a rectangle. Do these form a group under function composition? If so, is the group abelian? Is it cyclic?\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 3.4\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.4\n\n\nFirst, we need to decide what are the symmetries of a rectangle. Playing around with that sheet of A4 paper on your desk should convince you that, apart from the identity, the only symmetries are a 180 degree rotation and the reflections in the horizontal and vertical axes. Using our usual notation, where we measure angles in radians and let the vertical line of reflection be \\(l_1\\) and the horizontal line be \\(l_2\\), the set of symmetries is \\(S = \\{e, r_{\\pi}, s_1, s_2\\}\\). The operation table is:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\circ&e&r_{\\pi}&s_1&s_2\\\\\n\\hline\ne&e&r_{\\pi}&s_1&s_2\\\\\nr_{\\pi}&r_{\\pi}&e&s_2&s_1\\\\\ns_1&s_1&s_2&e&r_{\\pi}\\\\\ns_2&s_2&s_1&r_{\\pi}&e\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nClearly the table demonstrates that the group axioms hold:\n\nthe set is under function composition as the body of the table contains only elements in the set;\nwe know that function composition is associative;\nthe is \\(e\\) as the \\(e\\) row and column repeat the index row and column;\nevery element has an in the set as the identity appears exactly once in each row and column.\n\nIt is also clear from the table that the group is abelian since the table is symmetric about the lead diagonal. This means that for all \\(x, y \\in S, x \\circ y = y \\circ x\\).\nIs the group cyclic? To be cyclic the group must have a generator and we know that a generator must have period equal to the order of the group. So, in this case, we are looking for an element of period 4. However, all non-identity elements have period 2 (we can see this directly from the table as the identity appears in all places on the lead diagonal) and hence the group cannot be cyclic.\nIt follows from this observation that the group cannot be isomorphic to \\(\\Z_4\\) (which is order 4, but cyclic). However, we know the group is abelian so it must be isomorphic to \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\), the only other isomorphically distinct group of order 4 (see later).",

Since there are 16 group elements this gives 16 cosets, but we know that this process partitions the set into equal-sized, distinct left cosets which are all the same size as \\(H\\), so we should expect to end up with eight distinct left cosets.\n\\(eH = \\{e \\circ e, e \\circ r_4\\} = \\{e, r_4\\}\\)\n\\(r_1H = \\{r_1 \\circ e, r_1 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{r_1, r_5\\}\\)\n\\(r_2H = \\{r_2 \\circ e, r_2 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{r_2, r_6\\}\\)\n\\(r_3H = \\{r_3 \\circ e, r_3, \\circ r_4\\} = \\{r_3, r_7\\}\\)\n\\(r_4H = \\{r_4 \\circ e, r_4 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{r_4, e \\} = eH\\)\n\\(r_5H = \\{r_5 \\circ e, r_5 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{r_5, r_1 \\} = r_1H\\)\n\\(r_6H = \\{r_6 \\circ e, r_6 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{r_6, r_2\\} = r_2H\\)\n\\(r_7H = \\{r_7 \\circ e, r_7 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{r_7, r_3\\} = r_3H\\)\n\\(s_1H = \\{s_1 \\circ e, s_1 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{s_1, s_5\\}\\)\n\\(s_2H = \\{s_2 \\circ e, s_2 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{s_2, s_6\\}\\)\n\\(s_3H = \\{s_3 \\circ e, s_3 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{s_3, s_7\\}\\)\n\\(s_4H = \\{s_4 \\circ e, s_4 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{s_4, s_8\\}\\)\n\\(s_5H = \\{s_5 \\circ e, s_5 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{s_5, s_1\\} = s_1H\\)\n\\(s_6H = \\{s_6 \\circ e, s_6 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{s_6, s_2\\} = s_2H\\)\n\\(s_7H = \\{s_7 \\circ e, s_7 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{s_7, s_3\\} = s_3H\\)\n\\(s_8H = \\{s_8 \\circ e, s_8 \\circ r_4\\} = \\{s_8, s_4\\} = s_4H\\)\nHence the distinct left cosets are \\(\\{e, r_4\\}\\), \\(\\{r_1, r_5\\}\\), \\(\\{r_2, r_6\\}\\), \\(\\{r_3, r_7\\}\\), \\(\\{s_1, s_5\\}\\), \\(\\{s_2, s_6\\}\\), \\(\\{s_3, s_7\\}\\), \\(\\{s_4, s_8\\}\\).\nThe distinct left cosets for the other subgroups are as follows (make sure you know how to obtain them):\n\\(H = \\{e, s_1\\}: \\ \\{e, s_1 \\}, \\{r_1, s_8\\}, \\{r_2, s_7\\}, \\{r_3, s_6\\}, \\{r_4, s_5\\}, \\{r_5, s_4\\}, \\{r_6, s_3\\}, \\{r_7, s_2\\}\\)\n\\(H = \\{e, s_2\\}: \\ \\{e, s_2\\}, \\{r_1, s_1\\}, \\{r_2, s_8\\}, \\{r_3, s_7\\}, \\{r_4, s_6\\}, \\{r_5, s_5\\}, \\{r_6, s_4\\}, \\{r_7, s_3\\}\\)\n\\(H = \\{e, s_3\\}: \\ \\{e, s_3\\}, \\{r_1, s_2\\}, \\{r_2, s_1\\}, \\{r_3, s_8\\}, \\{r_4, s_7\\}, \\{r_5, s_6\\}, \\{r_6, s_5\\}, \\{r_7, s_4\\}\\)\n\\(H = \\{e, s_4\\}: \\ \\{e, s_4\\}, \\{r_1, s_3\\}, \\{r_2, s_2\\}, \\{r_3, s_1\\}, \\{r_4, s_8\\}, \\{r_5, s_7\\}, \\{r_6, s_6\\}, \\{r_7, s_5\\}\\)\n\\(H = \\{e, s_5\\}: \\ \\{e, s_5\\}, \\{r_1, s_4\\}, \\{r_2, s_3\\}, \\{r_3, s_2\\}, \\{r_4, s_1\\}, \\{r_5, s_8\\}, \\{r_6, s_7\\}, \\{r_7, s_6\\}\\)\n\\(H = \\{e, s_6\\}: \\ \\{e, s_6\\}, \\{r_1, s_5\\}, \\{r_2, s_4\\}, \\{r_3, s_3\\}, \\{r_4, s_2\\}, \\{r_5, s_1\\}, \\{r_6, s_8\\}, \\{r_7, s_7\\}\\)\n\\(H = \\{e, s_7\\}: \\ \\{e, s_7\\}, \\{r_1, s_6\\}, \\{r_2, s_5\\}, \\{r_3, s_4\\}, \\{r_4, s_3\\}, \\{r_5, s_2\\}, \\{r_6, s_1\\}, \\{r_7, s_8\\}\\)\n\\(H = \\{e, s_8\\}: \\ \\{e, s_8\\}, \\{r_1, s_7\\}, \\{r_2, s_6\\}, \\{r_3, s_5\\}, \\{r_4, s_4\\}, \\{r_5, s_3\\}, \\{r_6, s_2\\}, \\{r_7, s_1\\}\\)\n\\(H = \\{e, r_4, s_1, s_5\\}: \\ \\{e, r_4, s_1, s_5\\}, \\{r_1, r_5, s_8, s_4\\}, \\{r_2, r_6, s_7, s_3\\}, \\{r_3, r_7, s_6, s_2\\}\\)\n\\(H = \\{e, r_4, s_2, s_6\\}: \\ \\{e, r_4, s_2, s_6\\}, \\{r_1, r_5, s_1, s_5\\}, \\{r_2, r_6, s_8, s_4\\}, \\{r_3, r_7, s_7, s_3\\}\\)\n\\(H = \\{e, r_4, s_3, s_7\\}: \\ \\{e, r_4, s_3, s_7\\}, \\{r_1, r_5, s_2, s_6\\}, \\{r_2, r_6, s_1, s_5\\}, \\{r_3, r_7, s_8, s_4\\}\\)\n\\(H = \\{e, r_4, s_4. s_8\\}: \\ \\{e, r_4, s_4, s_8\\}, \\{r_1, r_5, s_3, s_7\\}, \\{r_2, r_6, s_2, s_6\\}, \\{r_3, r_7, s_1, s_5\\}\\).",

    "text": "5.1 Group Isomorphisms\nLet \\(G_1\\) be the group formed by \\(\\{1, -1, i, -i \\}\\) under multiplication and \\(G_2\\) be the subgroup of the group of symmetries of a square generated by \\(r_1\\), an anticlockwise rotation of \\(\\pi/2\\) radians; thus \\(G_2\\) is the group \\((\\{ e, r_1, r_2, r_3 \\}, \\circ)\\) where the operation is function composition. These two groups produce the following operation tables:\n\\[\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n\\times&1&-1&i&-i\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&-1&i&-i\\\\\n-1&-1&1&-i&i\\\\\ni&i&-i&-1&1\\\\\n-i&-i&i&1&-1\n\\end{array}\n\\hspace{3cm}\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\circ&e&r_1&r_2&r_3\\\\\n\\hline\ne&e&r_1&r_2&r_3\\\\\nr_1&r_1&r_2&r_3&e\\\\\nr_2&r_2&r_3&e&r_1\\\\\nr_3&r_3&e&r_1&r_2\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThese groups are ‘essentially the same’. To see this, in the first table, replace 1 by \\(e\\), \\(-1\\) by \\(r_2\\), \\(i\\) by \\(r_1\\) and \\(-i\\) by \\(r_3\\). What we get is the second table re-ordered slightly:\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\circ&e&r_2&r_1&r_3\\\\\n\\hline\ne&e&r_2&r_1&r_3\\\\\nr_2&r_2&e&r_3&r_1\\\\\nr_1&r_1&r_3&r_2&e\\\\\nr_3&r_3&r_1&e&r_2\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nWe have swapped the 2nd and 3rd rows and columns. Notice that the multiplication works the same in the re-ordered table as in the original.\nMore formally, what we have is a bijective map \\(\\theta:G_1 \\to G_2\\) by\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\theta(1) &=& e \\\\\n\\theta(-1) &=& r_2 \\\\\n\\theta(i) &=& r_1 \\\\\n\\theta(-i) &=& r_3.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nThe fact that when we replace the elements in the first table with their image under \\(\\theta\\) gives a rearrangement of the second table is captured precisely by the fact that for all \\(x,y \\in G_1\\), \\(\\theta(x \\times y) = \\theta(x) \\circ \\theta(y)\\).\nNotice that for any group, \\(G\\), the identity mapping is an isomorphism from \\(G\\) to itself. Also, if \\(\\theta\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G_1\\) to \\(G_2\\), then \\(\\theta^{-1}\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G_2\\) to \\(G_1\\) (we therefore talk about groups being isomorphic to each other). Furthermore, if \\(\\theta\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G_1\\) to \\(G_2\\) and \\(\\phi\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G_2\\) to \\(G_3\\), then \\(\\phi \\circ \\theta\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G_1\\) to \\(G_3\\).\nNotationally, if \\(\\theta : G_1 \\rightarrow G_2\\) is an isomorphism, we say that \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) are isomorphic and write \\(G_1 \\cong G_2\\).\nHow do we show that two groups \\((G_1, *)\\) and \\((G_2, \\odot)\\) are isomorphic? For small groups we can use trial and error, but for large groups, and certainly for infinite groups, we need a different approach.\nStep 1:\n\nFind a candidate function \\(\\theta: G_1 \\to G_2\\).\n\nStep 2:\n\nShow that \\(\\theta\\) is injective. That is, we show that for any pair \\(a,b \\in G_1\\) such that \\(\\theta(a) = \\theta(b)\\) then \\(a=b\\).\n\nStep 3:\n\nShow that \\(\\theta\\) is surjective. That is, we show that given \\(x \\in G_2\\) there is an element \\(a \\in G_1\\), such that \\(\\theta(a) = x\\).\n\nStep 4:\n\nStep 2 and Step 3 above establish the fact that \\(\\theta\\) is a bijection. To show that \\(\\theta\\) is an homomorphism, we lastly need to verify that for all \\(a,b \\in G_1\\), \\[\\theta(a \\ast b) = \\theta(a) \\odot \\theta(b).\\]\nHow do we show that two groups \\((G_1, *)\\) and \\((G_2, \\odot)\\) are not isomorphic? This would mean that there is no bijective function from \\(G_1\\) to \\(G_2\\) such that \\(\\theta (x*y) = \\theta (x) \\odot \\theta (y)\\), for all \\(x, y \\in G_1\\). In general we cannot try all possible bijections unless, of course, none exist, for example when \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) have different orders.\nWe say that the order of a group is preserved by isomorphism. The following lemma provides more such properties and these are frequently helpful in showing that two groups are not isomorphic, or in spotting an isomorphism if there is one.\nOne of the major questions in the study of groups is, for a given positive integer \\(n\\), what are the groups of order \\(n\\) up to isomorphism? What we mean by this is, can we describe a set of isomorphically distinct groups of order \\(n\\) which is complete in the sense that every group of order \\(n\\) is isomorphic to a member of this set? We will show that the answer is easy to describe for abelian groups, but the answer for non-abelian groups required many years of research (and, arguably, has yet to be completed). Below we give a complete list of isomorphically distinct groups of order less than eight. We have already seen \\(\\Z_n\\) as the canonical form of a cyclic group of order \\(n\\), generated by the element 1; we shall study groups of the type \\(\\Z_m \\times \\Z_n\\) in Chapter 7.\nNote that \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\) is the smallest non-cyclic group and \\(D_3\\) the smallest non-abelian group.\nThere are five isomorphically distinct groups of order 8; three of these are abelian, namely \\(\\Z_8\\), \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4\\) and \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\) (spotting a pattern?) and two are non-abelian, namely \\(D_4\\) and the quaternion group \\(Q_8\\).\nObserve, also, that so far we only have one group of order \\(n\\) when \\(n\\) is prime; this is a consequence of the following result combined with the fact that, by Theorem 4.2, a group of prime order is necessarily cyclic.\nWe now state and prove an extremely important and useful result:",

We have \\[\\theta(x^{i}) = \\theta(x\\ast x^{i-1}) = \\theta(x)\\odot\\theta(x^{i-1}) = \\theta(x)\\odot(\\theta(x))^{i-1} = (\\theta(x))^{i}.\\]\n\n\nNow we consider two cases.\nFirstly that \\(x\\) has infinite period. Suppose \\((\\theta(x))^{i} = \\theta(e)\\) for some \\(i \\in \\Z^{+}\\). This means, by the preceding, that \\(\\theta(x^{i}) = \\theta(e)\\). However, \\(\\theta\\) is a bijection, and so it is injective, it follows that \\(x^{i} = e\\). This is a contradiction. We conclude that \\((\\theta(x))^{i}\\) is not the identity element of \\(G_2\\) for any \\(i \\in \\Z^{+}\\) — \\(\\theta(x)\\) also has infinite order.\nNow suppose that \\(x\\) has period \\(m\\). We observe that \\[(\\theta(x))^{m} = \\theta(x^{m}) = \\theta(e)\\] and so the period of \\(\\theta(x)\\) is at most \\(m\\). However, if \\((\\theta(x))^{l}\\) is not the identity element of \\(G_2\\) for any \\(0 \\le l &lt;m\\), since, as in the previous case, this will mean that \\(\\theta(x^{l}) = \\theta(e)\\) and so \\(x^{l} = e\\) which is not possible.\n\n(\\(\\rightarrow\\)):\n\nSuppose that \\((G, \\ast)\\) is abelian. Let \\(x,y \\in G_2\\) be arbitrary. There are elements \\(a,b \\in G_1\\) such that \\(\\theta(a) = x\\) and \\(\\theta(b) = y\\). Now observe \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nx \\odot y &=& \\theta(a) \\odot \\theta(b)\\\\\n          &=& \\theta(a \\ast b) \\\\\n          &=& \\theta(b \\ast a) \\\\\n          &=& \\theta(b) \\ast \\theta(a) \\\\\n          &=& y \\odot x.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nWe conclude that \\(x \\odot y = y \\odot x\\) for all \\(x,y \\in G_2\\).\n\n(\\(\\leftarrow\\)):\n\nSuppose that \\((G_2, \\odot)\\) is abelian. Let \\(a,b \\in G_1\\). Since \\(\\theta\\) is a bijection, we can find \\(x,y \\in G_2\\) such that \\(a = \\theta(x)\\) and \\(b = \\theta(y)\\). Now observe that \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\na \\ast b &=& \\theta^{-1}(\\theta((a\\ast b )\\\\\n          &=& \\theta^{-1}(theta(a) \\odot \\theta(b)) \\\\\n          &=& \\theta^{-1}(\\theta(b) \\odot \\theta(a)) \\\\\n          &=& \\theta^{-1}(\\theta(b\\ast a)) \\\\\n          &=& b \\ast a.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] Therefore, \\(a \\ast b = b \\ast a\\) for all \\(a,b \\in G_1\\) and \\((G_1, \\ast)\\) is abelian.\n\n\nWe apply The Subgroup Test to \\(\\theta(H)\\). Clearly \\(\\theta(H)\\) is non-empty as it contains \\(\\theta(e)\\) (\\(e \\in H\\).)\n\nClosure:\n\nLet \\(h_1,h_2 \\in H\\). We want to show that \\(\\theta(h_1) \\odot \\theta(h_2) \\in \\theta(H)\\). We have: \\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\theta(h_1) \\odot \\theta(h_2) = \\theta(h_1 \\ast h_2).\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nTherefore, as \\(h_1 \\ast h_2 \\in H\\), \\(\\theta(h_1) \\odot \\theta(h_2) \\in \\theta(H)\\).\n\nInverses:\n\nLet \\(h_1 \\in H\\). Then, by part ii. \\((\\theta(h_1))^{-1} = \\theta(h_1^{-1})\\). Since \\(h_1 \\in H\\), and \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\((G, \\ast)\\), then \\(h_1^{-1} \\in H\\) and \\((\\theta(h_1))^{-1} \\in \\theta(H)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder\nGroup\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder 1\n\\(\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n  +&0\\\\\n  \\hline\n  0&0\n  \\end{array}\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\\(\\Z_1\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\n\n\nOrder 2\n\\(\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n  +&0&1\\\\\n  \\hline\n  0&0&1\\\\\n  1&1&0\\\\\n  \\end{array}\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\\(\\Z_2\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\n\n\nOrder 3\n\\(\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n  +&0&1&2\\\\\n  \\hline\n  0&0&1&2\\\\\n  1&1&2&0\\\\\n  2&2&0&1\\\\\n  \\end{array}\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\\(\\Z_3\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\n\n\nOrder 4\n\\(\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n  +&0&1&2&3\\\\\n  \\hline\n  0&0&1&2&3\\\\\n  1&1&2&3&0\\\\\n  2&2&3&0&1\\\\\n  3&3&0&1&2\\\\\n  \\end{array}\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\\(\\Z_4\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\\(\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n+&0&1&2&3\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&1&2&3\\\\\n1&1&0&3&2\\\\\n2&2&3&0&1\\\\\n3&3&2&1&0\\\\\n\\end{array}\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\n\nOrder 5\n\\(\\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}\n  +&0&1&2&3&4\\\\\n  \\hline\n  0&0&1&2&3&4\\\\\n  1&1&2&3&4&0\\\\\n  2&2&3&4&0&1\\\\\n  3&3&4&0&1&2\\\\\n  4&4&0&1&2&3\\\\\n  \\end{array}\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\\(\\Z_5\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\n\n\nOrder 6\n\\(\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n  +&0&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n  \\hline\n  0&0&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n  1&1&2&3&4&5&0\\\\\n  2&2&3&4&5&0&1\\\\\n  3&3&4&5&0&1&2\\\\\n  4&4&5&0&1&2&3\\\\\n  5&5&0&1&2&3&4\n  \\end{array}\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\\(\\Z_6\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\\(\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n+&0&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n1&1&2&0&5&3&4\\\\\n2&2&0&1&4&5&3\\\\\n3&3&4&5&0&1&2\\\\\n4&4&5&3&2&0&1\\\\\n5&5&3&4&1&2&0\n\\end{array}\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\\(D_3\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\n\nOrder 7\n\\(\\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}\n  +&0&1&2&3&4&5&6\\\\\n  \\hline\n  0&0&1&2&3&4&5&6\\\\\n  1&1&2&3&4&5&6&0\\\\\n  2&2&3&4&5&6&0&1\\\\\n  3&3&4&5&6&0&1&2\\\\\n  4&4&5&6&0&1&2&3\\\\\n  5&5&6&0&1&2&3&4\\\\\n  6&6&0&1&2&3&4&5\n\\end{array}\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\\(\\Z_7\\)\n\\(\\phantom{text}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 5.1 Two cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic.\n\n\nProof. \n\nLet \\(G_1 = \\gen{a}\\) and \\(G_2 = \\gen{b}\\) be cyclic groups of the same order. Define a map \\(\\theta: G_1 \\to G_2\\) by \\(\\theta(a^{i}) = b^{i}\\) for all \\(i \\in \\Z\\)\nClearly \\(\\theta\\) is surjective since \\(G_2 = \\{b^{i} : i \\in \\Z\\}\\).\nSuppose \\(\\theta(a^{i}) = \\theta(a^{j})\\) for \\(i,j \\in \\Z\\). Then \\(b^{i} = b^{j}\\). Therefore, \\(b^{i-j} = e_{G_{2}}\\). This only happens if \\(b\\) has finite period \\(m\\) such that \\(m| (i-j)\\). In this case there is a \\(k \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(i = j+ km\\). Now, since the period of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are equal, we must have that \\[a^{i} = a^{j+km} = a^{j}(a^{m})^{k} = a^{j}e_{G_{1}} = a^{j}.\\] We conclude that \\(\\theta\\) is injective.\nFinally let \\(a^{i},a^{j} \\in \\gen{a}\\). Then\n\\[\\theta(a^{i}a^{j})= \\theta(a^{i+j}) = b^{i+j} = b^{i}b^{j} = \\theta(a^{i})\\theta(a^{j}).\\]\nTherefore \\(\\theta\\) is an isomorphism and \\(G_1 \\cong G_2\\).\n\n\n\nExample 5.3 We have shown that the set \\[M=\n\\left\\{\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}a&b\\\\-b&a\\end{array}\\right)\n\\in\\R_{2\\times 2}:a,b\\mbox{ not both zero}\\right\\},\\] forms a subgroup of GL\\((2, \\R)\\) under matrix multiplication. Show that \\(M\\) is isomorphic to \\((\\C \\backslash \\{0\\}, \\times)\\).\n\nSolution:\n\nStep 1:\n\nDefine a map \\(\\theta: M \\to \\C \\backslash\\{0\\}\\) by \\[\\theta\\left( \\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\ -b & a\\end{pmatrix}\\right) = a+ib.\\] Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not both zero, it is clear that \\(a+ib \\ne 0\\).\n\nStep 2:\n\nWe show that \\(\\theta\\) is injective. Let \\[A = \\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\ -b & a\\end{pmatrix} \\text{ and } C=\\begin{pmatrix}c & d \\\\ -d & c\\end{pmatrix} \\in M.\\] Suppose that \\(\\theta(A) = \\theta(C)\\). Then \\(a+ib = c + id\\). This is only possible if \\(a=c\\) and \\(b=c\\). This means that \\(A=C\\). It follows that \\(\\theta\\) is injective.\n\nStep3:\n\nWe show that \\(\\theta\\) is surjective. Let \\(a+ib \\in \\C\\backslash\\{0\\}\\). Notice that since \\(a+ib \\ne 0\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not both zero. Therefore \\[A= \\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\ -b & a\\end{pmatrix} \\in M.\\] Moreover, \\(\\theta(A) = a+ib\\).\n\nStep 4:\n\nLet \\[A = \\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\ -b & a\\end{pmatrix}\\] and \\[C = \\begin{pmatrix}c & d \\\\ -d & c\\end{pmatrix}\\] be elements of \\(M\\). Then \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\theta(AC) &=& \\theta\\left(\\begin{pmatrix}ac - bd & ad+bc \\\\ -(ad+bc) & ac-bd\\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\\\ &=& (ac-bd) + i(ad+ab) \\\\ &=& (a+ib) (c+id) \\\\ &=& \\theta(A)\\theta(C).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nIt follows that \\(\\theta: (M, \\times) \\to (\\C \\backslash\\{0\\},\\times)\\) is an isomorphism and so \\((M,\\times) \\cong (\\C \\backslash\\{0\\},\\times)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.4 How do you know that the group represented by the following operation table must be isomorphic to \\(\\Z_6\\)? Find an isomorphism between the two groups.\n\nSolution:\nIf the group represented by the table is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_6\\), then it must have an element of order \\(6\\). Notice that \\(a\\) has to be the identity element since \\(a \\ast x = x\\) for all \\(x \\in \\{a,b,c,d,e,f\\}\\). We can now work through the elements in turn to see which have order \\(6\\). For \\(b\\) we observe that \\[b^2 = c, \\ b^3 = bc =f,\\ b^4 = bf=e,\\ b^5 = be=d,\\ b^6 = bd =a.\\]\nTherefore \\(b\\) has order \\(6\\). Following the proof of Theorem 5.1, the map \\(\\theta: \\gen{b} \\to \\Z_{6}\\) by \\(b^{i} = i\\) for all \\(0 \\le i \\le 5\\) is an isomorphism.",

    "text": "5.2 Group Homomorphisms\nAs we mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, we are interested in functions that preserve structure. Such functions are called homomorphisms. We begin with a definition.\n\nDefinition 5.2 (Homomorphism) Let \\((G_1, *)\\) and \\((G_2, \\circ)\\) be groups. A mapping \\(\\phi:G_1 \\rightarrow G_2\\) is a (group) homomorphism if and only if for all \\(x, y \\in G_1\\) \\[\\phi(x*y) = \\phi(x) \\circ \\phi(y).\\]\n\nNote that an isomorphism is precisely a bijective homomorphism.\n\nExample 5.5 (Positive and Negative examples)  \n\n\\(G_1=G_2=(\\R, +), \\; \\phi(x)=|x|, \\; \\forall \\, x \\in \\R\\).\n\nThis map is not a homomorphism. Consider \\(-2,3 \\in \\R\\), \\[\\phi(3+(-1)) = \\phi(2) = |2| \\ne 4 = |3| + |-1| = \\phi(3) + \\phi(-1).\\]\n\n\\(G_1=G_2=(\\rwz, \\times), \\; \\phi(x)=|x|, \\; \\forall \\, x \\in \\rwz\\).\n\nThis map is a homomorphism. Let \\(x,y \\in \\rwz\\). Then \\[\\phi(xy) = |xy| = |x||y| = \\phi(x)\\phi(y).\\] Note that \\(\\phi\\) is not an isomorphism since it is not a bijection.\n\n\\(G_1= GL(2, \\R), G_2=(\\rwz, \\times), \\; \\phi(A)=\\text{det}\\, A, \\; \\forall \\, A \\in GL(2, \\R)\\).\n\nThis map is a homomorphism. Let \\(A,B \\in G_1\\). Then, \\[\\phi(AB)=\\det AB = \\det A \\det B = \\phi(A)\\phi(B).\\] Note that \\(\\phi\\) is not an isomorphism. There are infinitely many elements of \\(G_1\\) with determinant equal to \\(1\\) for example.\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.6 Consider the function \\(f : \\C \\backslash \\{0\\} \\rightarrow \\R \\backslash \\{0\\}\\) defined by \\[\\forall \\, a, b \\in \\R, \\quad f(a + ib) = a^2 + b^2.\\] Establish whether \\(f\\) is a homomorphism, and whether it is an isomorphism, from \\((\\C \\backslash \\{0\\}, \\times)\\) to \\((\\R \\backslash \\{0\\}, \\times)\\).\n\nSolution:\nLet \\(a+ib, c+id \\in \\cwz\\) for where \\(a,b,c,d \\in \\R\\). Then \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nf((a+ib)(c+id)) &=& f((ac-bd) + i(bc + ad))\\\\\n&=& (ac- bd)^2 + (bc + ad)^2 \\\\\n&=& a^2c^2 - 2acbd + b^2d^2 + b^2c^2 + 2abcd + a^2d^2 \\\\\n&=& a^2c^2 + b^2d^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2d^2 \\\\\n&=& c^2\\left(a^2 + b^2\\right) + d^2\\left(a^2 + b^2\\right) \\\\\n&=& \\left(a^2 + b^2\\right) \\left(c^2 + d^2\\right) \\\\\n&=& f(a+ib)f(c+id)\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nIt follows that \\(f\\) is a homomorphism. Note that \\(f\\) is not an isomorphism since it is not a bijection. Indeed \\(f\\) is not surjective since there is no \\(z \\in \\cwz\\) such that \\(f(z) = -1\\) for example.\n\n\n\nExample 5.7 Let \\((G_1,\\circ)\\) and \\((G_2,*)\\) be groups and \\(\\theta:G_1 \\rightarrow G_2\\) be a surjective homomorphism. For each of the following statements, either prove that it is true or provide a counter-example.\n\nIf \\((G_1,\\circ)\\) is abelian, then \\((G_2,*)\\) is abelian.\nIf \\((G_2, *)\\) is abelian, then \\((G_1,\\circ)\\) abelian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat goes wrong?\n\n\n\nWhat is wrong with the following argument: Let \\(a,b \\in G_1\\). Then: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\theta(a \\circ b) &=& \\theta(a) \\ast \\theta(b) \\\\\n&=& \\theta(b) \\ast \\theta(a) \\\\\n&=& \\theta(b \\circ a).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nThus, \\(\\theta(a \\circ b) = \\theta(b \\circ a)\\) and so \\(a \\circ b = b \\circ a\\) for all \\(a, b \\in G_1\\).\n\nThis argument does not work because \\(\\theta\\) might not necessarily be injective and so we cannot conclude that \\(a \\circ b = b \\circ a\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nThis statement is true. Let \\(x,y \\in G_2\\). Since \\(\\theta\\) is surjective, there are \\(a,b \\in G_1\\) such that \\(\\theta(a) = x\\) and \\(\\theta(b) =y\\). We now have: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nx \\ast y &=& \\theta(a) \\ast \\theta(b) \\\\\n&=& \\theta(a \\circ b) \\\\\n&=& \\theta(b \\circ a) \\\\\n&=& \\theta(b)\\circ \\theta(a) \\\\\n&=& y \\ast x.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nTherefore \\(x \\ast y = y \\ast x\\) for all \\(x,y \\in G_2\\).\nThis statement is false. Indeed we have already seen a counter example. The map \\(\\mathrm{det}: GL(2,\\R) \\to \\rwz\\) is a homomorphism, however \\(GL(2,\\R)\\) is a non-abelian group.\n\n\n\nAs we have said, a homomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping. If \\(\\phi\\) is a homomorphism from a group \\(G\\) into a group \\(\\gp\\), then we can get information about the structural properties of \\(\\gp\\) from the structural properties of \\(G\\). An example of this is provided by the following lemma:\n\nLemma 5.2 Let \\(\\phi\\) be a homomorphism from a group \\(G\\) to a group \\(\\gp\\). Then,\n\nif \\(e\\) is the identity in \\(G\\), then \\(\\phi(e)\\) is the identity in \\(\\gp\\),\nfor all \\(x \\in G\\), \\(\\phi(x^{-1})=(\\phi(x))^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\nProof. \n\n\nWe have \\[\\phi(e) = \\phi(ee) = \\phi(e)\\phi(e).\\] It follows that \\(\\phi(e)\\) must be the identity element of \\(\\gp\\) by cancelling.\nLet \\(x \\in G\\). We have, \\[\\phi(e) = \\phi(xx^{-1}) = \\phi(x)\\phi(x^{-1}).\\] We conclude that \\(\\phi(x) = (\\phi(x))^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\nIn the case of an isomorphism, the bijectivity of the function means that we preserve not only the structure but also the ‘size’, in the sense that isomorphic groups must have the same order. It is natural in the case of non-bijective homomorphisms, therefore, to investigate how structure is preserved between groups of different orders; that is, to investigate how the function ‘scales’ the structure that it preserves. A very loose analogy would be to consider a map of England, say, but being careful how the word ‘map’ is used. One possible scaling would be to map everything to a single point; small enough to fit in your pocket, totally useless, but still a map! Alternatively one could use a scale of 1:1 which would make the map an exact replica in terms of size, but again the utility of such a map is open to doubt. In practical terms we need something that scales down the original to a usable size. Using this as an analogy, where the ‘scaling factor’ is represented by our group homomorphism, the first case would be tantamount to mapping everything in \\(G\\) onto just one element of \\(\\gp\\), whereas the second case would represent an isomorphism. So, what about something in between? First, we make the following definitions.\n\nDefinition 5.3 (Image and Preimage) Let \\(f\\) be a mapping of a set \\(X\\) into a set \\(Y\\), and let \\(A \\subseteq X\\) and \\(B \\subseteq Y\\) The image of \\(A\\) under \\(f\\), which is a subset of \\(Y\\), is denoted and defined by \\[f(A) = \\{f(a) \\where a \\in A \\}.\\] The preimage of \\(B\\) under \\(f\\), which is a subset of \\(X\\), is denoted and defined by \\[f^{-1}(B) = \\{ x \\in X \\where f(x) \\in B \\}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first observation to make at this juncture is that the image of a group under a group homomorphism is a group. This follows if \\(H=G\\) in the theorem below.\n\nTheorem 5.2 Let \\(\\phi\\) be a group homomorphism from \\(G\\) into \\(\\gp\\). Then, for any subgroup \\(H\\) of \\(G\\), \\(\\phi(H)\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\gp\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nWe carry out the Subgroup Test on \\(\\phi(H)\\). We note that \\(\\phi(H)\\) is non-empty as it contains \\(\\phi(e)\\) the identity element of \\(\\gp\\).\nLet \\(a,b \\in H\\). We want to show that \\(\\phi(a)\\phi(b)\\) is en element of \\(\\phi(H)\\). Observe that: \\[\\phi(ab) = \\phi(a)\\phi(b).\\] Since \\(ab \\in H\\), it follows that \\(\\phi(ab) \\in \\phi(H)\\) and so \\(\\phi(a)\\phi(b) \\in \\phi(H)\\) as required.\nLet \\(a \\in H\\). We want to show that \\((\\phi(a))^{-1} \\in \\phi(H)\\). However, \\(\\phi(a^{-1}) = (\\phi(a))^{-1}\\). Since \\(a^{-1} \\in H\\), we conclude that \\((\\phi(a))^{-1} \\in \\phi(H)\\) as required.\n\n\nIf we are to continue our analogy, we need to consider a suitable ‘scaling’ factor. Suppose we consider the set of elements of \\(G\\) that map onto the identity in \\(\\gp\\) under some homomorphism \\(\\phi\\). This leads to the following formal definition:\n\nDefinition 5.4 (Kernel) Let \\(\\phi\\) be a group homomorphism from a group \\(G\\) into a group \\(\\gp\\) and \\(e^{\\prime}\\) be the identity in \\(\\gp\\). The kernel of \\(\\phi\\) is denoted and defined by \\[\\krn (\\phi) = \\{ x \\in G \\where \\phi(x)=e^{\\prime}\\}.\\]\n\n\nExample 5.8  \n\nLet \\(\\phi: \\Z \\to \\Z_2\\) be defined by \\[ \\phi(n) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{ if } n \\text{ is even, } \\\\ 1 & \\text{ if } n \\text{ is odd. } \\end{cases}\\] Then \\(\\phi\\) is a homomorphism and \\(\\krn(\\phi) = 2\\Z\\).\n\n\n\nExample 5.9  \n\nLet \\(\\phi: GL(2,\\R) \\to \\R\\backslash\\{0\\}\\) by \\(\\phi(A) = \\det(A)\\). Then \\(\\phi\\) is a homomorphism and \\(\\krn(\\phi) = \\{A \\in GL(2,\\R) \\mid \\det(A) = 1\\}\\).\n\n\n\nExample 5.10  \n\nLet \\(G= \\Z_6\\) and \\(G'\\) be the subgroup \\(\\gen{r_1} = \\gen{r_2} =  \\{e,r_1,r_2\\}\\) of \\(D_3\\).\nDefine \\(\\phi: G \\to G'\\) by \\(\\phi(n) = r_1^{n}\\). Then \\(\\phi\\) is a homomorphism (check this as an exercise). Looking at the image of \\(\\phi\\) we have: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\phi(0) &=& e \\\\\n\\phi(1) &=& r_1 \\\\\n\\phi(2) &=& r_2 \\\\\n\\phi(3) &=& e \\\\\n\\phi(4) &=& r_1 \\\\\n\\phi(5) &=& r_2.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nIt follows that \\(\\krn(\\phi) = \\{0,3\\}\\). Observe that \\(\\krn(\\phi) = \\gen{3}\\) and so \\(\\krn(\\phi)\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\Z_{6}\\).\n\n\nWhat can we say about the kernel of a homomorphism? Actually, quite a lot, and such matters will be studied in detail in the Year 3 Group Theory module. For the moment, though, we shall restrict our attention to two properties.\n\nTheorem 5.3 Let \\(\\phi\\) be a group homomorphism from \\(G\\) into \\(\\gp\\). Then, \\(\\krn (\\phi)\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nNotice that \\(\\krn(\\phi)\\) is a non-empty subset of \\(G\\) since it contains the identity element of \\(G\\) (\\(\\phi(e) = e'\\) where \\(e'\\) is the identity element of \\(G'\\)).\nLet \\(a,b \\in \\krn(\\phi)\\). Then, \\[\\phi(ab) = \\phi(a)\\phi(b) = e'e' = e'.\\] Thus \\(ab \\in \\krn(\\phi)\\).\nLet \\(a \\in \\krn(\\phi)\\). Then, \\[\\phi(a^{-1}) = (\\phi(a))^{-1} = (e')^{-1} = e'.\\] Therefore \\(a^{-1} \\in \\krn(\\phi)\\).\nIt follows that \\(\\krn(\\phi)\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\n\nIn fact, the kernel of a homomorphism is more than a mere subgroup of the domain; it is what is known as a normal subgroup, which is characterised by the property that its left and right cosets coincide (again, more of normal subgroups next year).\nFor the second property we need to revisit the example above where we had a homomorphism mapping from \\(\\Z_6\\) to the subgroup of \\(D_3\\) containing the identity and the rotations \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\). Consider the sizes of the sets involved….\n\n\n\n\nSize of set\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(|\\Z_6| = 6\\)\nDomain of \\(\\phi\\)\n\n\n\\(|\\{e,r_1,r_2\\}|=3\\)\nImage of \\(\\phi\\)\n\n\n\\(|\\ker(\\phi)| = |\\{0,3\\}|=2\\)\nKernel of \\(\\phi\\)\n\n\n\nNotice that \\[\\frac{\\text{Size of group}}{\\text{Size of kernel}} = \\text{ Size of Image}.\\]\n\nThis result holds for finite groups in general; that is, if a homomorphism \\(\\phi\\) maps from a group \\(G\\) to a group \\(\\gp\\), then the size of the image of \\(G\\) under \\(\\phi\\) is equal to the size of \\(G\\) divided by the size of the kernel of \\(\\phi\\). This is scratching the surface of a major structural theorem of groups, namely the First Isomorphism Theorem (not surprisingly, studied in detail in Year 3 Group Theory!).",

It involves moving a point a fixed distance parallel to the x-axis, that distance being dependent on the y-coordinate of the point. Such transformations can be represented by \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrices of the form \\(\\left( \\begin{array}{cc}1 & a\\\\0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right)\\), where \\(a\\) is any real number.)\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 5.1\n\n\n\n\nSolution 5.1\n\n\nFirst we need to remind ourselves of the matrix representation of a shear and how it acts on a point (it’s a function). It involves moving a point a fixed distance parallel to the x-axis, that distance being dependent on the y-coordinate of the point.\nSo, given any point \\((x, y)\\) in the plane, the transformation produces the shear as follows: \\[\\left( \\begin{array}{cc}1 & a\\\\0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c}x\\\\y \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{c}x + ay\\\\y \\end{array} \\right).\\]\nLet \\(G = (\\R, +)\\) and \\(H =  \\left( \\left\\{ \\left( \\begin{array}{cc}1 & a\\\\0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\; | \\; a \\in \\R \\right\\} , \\times \\right)\\).\nDefine \\(f : G \\rightarrow H\\) by \\(f(a) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc}1 & a\\\\0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right)\\). Then, clearly, this is a bijective function. Now we just need to show that \\(\\forall a, b \\in G\\), \\(f(a+b) = f(a) f(b)\\).\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nf(a+b) &=& \\left( \\begin{array}{cc}1 & a+b\\\\0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right)\\\\\nf(a) f(b) &=& \\left( \\begin{array}{cc}1 & a\\\\0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right)\\left( \\begin{array}{cc}1 & b\\\\0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc}1 & b+a\\\\0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right)\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nSo, \\(f(a+b) = f(a) f(b)\\) and, hence, \\(f\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G\\) to \\(H\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5.2\n\n\nConsider the set \\(G = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). This set forms a group under multiplication modulo 7.\n\nDraw and complete the operation table for the group \\((G, \\otimes_7)\\).\nFind the period of each element in the group.\nFind an isomorphism between this group and \\(\\Z_6\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 5.2\n\n\n\n\nSolution 5.2\n\n\n\nThe table is as follows: \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n\\otimes_7&1&2&3&4&5&6\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&2&3&4&5&6\\\\\n2&2&4&6&1&3&5\\\\\n3&3&6&2&5&1&4\\\\\n4&4&1&5&2&6&3\\\\\n5&5&3&1&6&4&2\\\\\n6&6&5&4&3&2&1\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThe periods of the elements are (together with those for \\(\\Z_6\\)) \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n\\text{element}&\\text{period}&\\Z_6\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&0\\\\\n2&3&2\\\\\n3&6&1\\\\\n4&3&4\\\\\n5&6&5\\\\\n6&2&3\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nLet \\(\\theta:G \\maps \\Z_6\\). We know that identity maps to identity so \\(\\theta(1) = 0\\). We also know that the period of an element \\(g \\in G\\) must be the same as the period of \\(\\theta(g)\\) in \\(\\Z_6\\). Since each group has only one element of period 2 we must also have that \\(\\theta(6)=3\\). Note that there are two elements of period 6 in each group (the cyclic generators of those groups). Suppose, therefore, that we chose \\(\\theta(3) = 1\\). This then fixes \\(\\theta(5) = 5\\).\nWe now consider \\(\\theta(2)\\). Remember that the operation in \\(G\\) is multiplication modulo 7 whereas the operation in \\(\\Z_6\\) is addition modulo 6. In \\(G\\) we have \\(3 \\times 3 = 9 \\equiv 2 \\modu 7)\\). Hence \\(\\theta(2) = \\theta(3\\times 3) = \\theta(3) + \\theta(3) = 1+1 = 2\\). So \\(\\theta(2) = 2\\) and then \\(\\theta(4) = 4\\) is fixed.\nHence an isomorphism is \\[\\theta = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccccc}1&2&3&4&5&6\\\\0&2&1&4&5&3\\end{array}\\right).\\]",

    "text": "6.1 Permutations\nIn the above example we refer to each arrangement as a permutation of the set of books. It should be clear that each permutation is simply a mapping from the set of books onto itself, where the mapping determines the order of the particular arrangement or permutation. Obviously, the mapping is a bijection (think about it) and we can now make the following formal definition.\nSince a permutation is a function, we can compose any number of permutations and, since a permutation is a bijective function, it makes sense to talk about its inverse.\nSo why study permutations in Abstract Algebra? Well, what should be obvious is that for any finite set \\(S\\), we can collect together all of the possible permutations of that set into another set. Then, much less obviously, that set of permutations forms a group under function composition. Furthermore, and far more surprisingly, it turns out that every finite group is isomorphic to a group of permutations!",

For example: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nf&=&(a \\; b \\; c \\; d)\\\\\nf^2&=&(a \\; c) (b \\; d)\\\\\nf^3&=&(a \\; d \\; c \\; b)\\\\\nf^4&=&(a) (b) (c) (d) = id.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nWe can now compute the period of \\(\\alpha\\) as follows:\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n\\alpha&=&(1 \\; 3 \\; 10)&(2 \\: 7 \\; 4)&(5 \\; 8 \\; 6 \\; 9)&=&(1 \\; 3 \\; 10)&(2 \\: 7 \\; 4)&(5 \\; 8 \\; 6 \\; 9)\\\\\n\\alpha^2&=&(1 \\; 10 \\; 3)&(2 \\: 4 \\; 7)&(5 \\; 6) (8 \\; 9)&=&(1 \\; 10 \\; 3)&(2 \\: 4 \\; 7)&(5 \\; 6) (8 \\; 9)\\\\\n\\alpha^3&=&(1) (10) (3)&(2) (4) (7)&(5 \\; 9 \\; 6 \\; 8)&=&id&id&(5 \\; 9 \\; 6 \\; 8)\\\\\n\\alpha^4&=&(1 \\; 3 \\; 10)&(2 \\: 7 \\; 4)&(5) (6) (8) (9)&=&(1 \\; 3 \\; 10)&(2 \\: 7 \\; 4)&id\\\\\n\\alpha^5&=&(1 \\; 10 \\; 3)&(2 \\: 4 \\; 7)&(5 \\; 8 \\; 6 \\; 9)&=&(1 \\; 10 \\; 3)&(2 \\: 4 \\; 7)&(5 \\; 8 \\; 6 \\; 9)\\\\\n\\alpha^6&=&(1) (10) (3)&(2) (4) (7)&(5 \\; 6) (8 \\; 9)&=&id&id&(5 \\; 6) (8 \\; 9)\\\\\n\\alpha^7&=&(1 \\; 3 \\; 10)&(2 \\: 7 \\; 4)&(5 \\; 9 \\; 6 \\; 8)&=&(1 \\; 3 \\; 10)&(2 \\: 7 \\; 4)&(5 \\; 9 \\; 6 \\; 8)\\\\\n\\alpha^8&=&(1 \\; 10 \\; 3)&(2 \\: 4 \\; 7)&(5) (6) (8) (9)&=&(1 \\; 10 \\; 3)&(2 \\: 4 \\; 7)&id\\\\\n\\alpha^9&=&(1) (10) (3)&(2) (4) (7)&(5 \\; 8 \\; 6 \\; 9)&=&id&id&(5 \\; 8 \\; 6 \\; 9)\\\\\n\\alpha^{10}&=&(1 \\; 3 \\; 10)&(2 \\: 7 \\; 4)&(5 \\; 6) (8 \\; 9)&=&(1 \\; 3 \\; 10)&(2 \\: 7 \\; 4)&(5 \\; 6) (8 \\; 9)\\\\\n\\alpha^{11}&=&(1 \\; 10 \\; 3)&(2 \\: 4 \\; 7)&(5 \\; 9 \\; 6 \\; 8)&=&(1 \\; 10 \\; 3)&(2 \\: 4 \\; 7)&(5 \\; 9 \\; 6 \\; 8)\\\\\n\\alpha^{12}&=&(1) (10) (3)&(2) (4) (7)&(5) (6) (8) (9)&=&id&id&id.\n\\end{array}\\]\nSo, the period of the permutation is 12. It should be clear, from this example, that the period of a permutation can be determined by finding the lowest common multiple of the lengths of its orbits. In this example we have that the period of \\(\\alpha\\) is lcm(3, 3, 4) = 12.",

    "text": "6.5 Permutations as Transpositions\nWe begin with a definition.\n\nDefinition 6.4 (Transposition) A cycle \\((i \\; j)\\) of length two interchanges, or transposes, \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) and is called a transposition.\n\nThe importance of transpositions is that any cycle may be expressed as a product of transpositions. Suppose we wish to arrange \\(\\spadesuit\\) \\(\\heartsuit\\) \\(\\diamondsuit\\) \\(\\clubsuit\\) as \\(\\clubsuit\\) \\(\\spadesuit\\) \\(\\heartsuit\\) \\(\\diamondsuit\\) using only transpositions (that is, swapping symbols two at a time). This corresponds to expressing the permutation \\((1 \\; 2 \\; 3 \\; 4)\\) as a product of transpositions. One way to do this is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\\(\\spadesuit\\)\n\\(\\heartsuit\\)\n\\(\\diamondsuit\\)\n\\(\\clubsuit\\)\n\n\napply \\((3 \\ 4)\\):\n\\(\\spadesuit\\)\n\\(\\heartsuit\\)\n\\(\\clubsuit\\)\n\\(\\diamondsuit\\)\n\n\napply \\((2 \\ 3)\\):\n\\(\\spadesuit\\)\n\\(\\clubsuit\\)\n\\(\\heartsuit\\)\n\\(\\diamondsuit\\)\n\n\napply \\((1 \\ 2)\\):\n\\(\\clubsuit\\)\n\\(\\spadesuit\\)\n\\(\\heartsuit\\)\n\\(\\diamondsuit\\)\n\n\n\nThus we have that \\[(1\\; 2\\; 3\\; 4) = (1\\; 2)(2 \\; 3)(3 \\; 4).\\]\nRecalling that this is function composition and, therefore, we start at the right-hand end of the product, we can state the following general formula: \\[(a_1 \\; a_2 \\; a_3 \\; \\ldots \\; a_{k-1} \\; a_k) = (a_1 \\; a_2)(a_2 \\; a_3) \\ldots (a_{k-1} \\; a_k).\\]\nWe could use an alternative approach as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\\(\\spadesuit\\)\n\\(\\heartsuit\\)\n\\(\\diamondsuit\\)\n\\(\\clubsuit\\)\n\n\napply \\((1 \\ 2)\\):\n\\(\\heartsuit\\)\n\\(\\spadesuit\\)\n\\(\\diamondsuit\\)\n\\(\\clubsuit\\)\n\n\napply \\((1 \\ 3)\\):\n\\(\\diamondsuit\\)\n\\(\\spadesuit\\)\n\\(\\heartsuit\\)\n\\(\\clubsuit\\)\n\n\napply \\((1 \\ 4)\\):\n\\(\\clubsuit\\)\n\\(\\spadesuit\\)\n\\(\\heartsuit\\)\n\\(\\diamondsuit\\)\n\n\n\nThus we have that \\[(1\\; 2\\; 3\\; 4) = (1\\; 4)(1 \\; 3)(1 \\; 2).\\] This illustrates an alternative general formula: \\[(a_1 \\; a_2 \\; a_3 \\; \\ldots \\; a_{k-1} \\; a_k) = (a_1 \\; a_k)(a_1 \\; a_{k-1}) \\ldots (a_1 \\; a_2).\\]\n\nExample 6.10 Express the permutation \\(f = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccccccccc}1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10\\\\2&9&7&1&5&10&8&3&4&6 \\end{array} \\right)\\) as a product of transpositions.\n\nSolution:\nFirst we express \\(f\\) as a product of disjoint cycles: \\[f = ( 1 \\ 2 \\ 9 \\ 4)(3 \\ 7 \\ 8)(6 \\ 10).\\] Using the first rule: \\[f = (1 \\ 2)(2 \\ 9)(9 \\ 4)(3 \\ 7)(7 \\ 8)(6 \\ 10).\\] Using the second rule: \\[(1 \\ 4)(1 \\ 9)(1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 8)(3 \\ 7)(6 \\ 10).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe write the identity permutation as a product of transpositions as follows: \\[(1 \\; 2)(1 \\; 2) = \\text{id}\\]\n\n\nIt is clear from what we have seen that the expression of a permutation as a product of transpositions is not unique. However, there is one feature of the composition that is constant and we shall now explore this. First, though, we consider the following example.\n\nExample 6.11 Let \\(f = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12\\\\8&6&1&9&5&2&7&3&12&10&4&11 \\end{array} \\right) \\in S_{12}\\). We can write this as the product of disjoint cycles:\n\n\\[f= (1 \\ 8 \\ 3)(2 \\ 6)(4 \\ 9 \\ 12 \\ 11) \\in S_{12}\\] notice that \\(f\\) has \\(5\\) orbits.\n\nWe now consider what happens if we ‘pre-multiply’ this permutation by a transposition \\((i \\; j)\\). We need to consider two cases:\n\nLet \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) be from different orbits\n\nFor example we could take \\(i =1\\) and \\(j=2\\). Then \\[(1 \\ 2)f = (1 \\ 8 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 6)(4 \\ 9 \\ 12 \\ 11).\\] The number of orbits of \\(f\\) is now \\(5\\) — the effect is to merge the orbits containing \\(1\\) and \\(2\\).\n\nLet \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) be from the same orbit\n\nFor example we can take \\(i = 1\\) and \\(j =3\\). Then \\[(1 \\ 3)f = (1 \\ 8)(3)(2 \\ 6)( 4 \\ 9 \\ 12 \\ 11).\\] The effect is to split the orbit containing \\(1\\) and \\(3\\) into two distinct orbits. Notice that the number of orbits of \\((i \\ j)f\\) and \\(f\\) in each case differ by \\(1\\).\n\n\n\nStrictly, we ought also to consider whether or not it matters if \\(i\\) or \\(j\\) come from an orbit of size 1.\n\nFor example, we could consider \\(i = 1\\) and \\(j=5\\).Then \\[(1 \\ 5) f = ( 1 \\ 8 \\ 3 \\ 5)(2 \\ 6)( 4 \\ 9 \\ 12 \\ 11).\\] Or \\(i= 5\\) and \\(j= 7\\), then \\[(5 \\ 7)f = (5 \\ 7)(1 \\ 8 \\ 3)(2 \\ 6)(4 \\ 9 \\ 12 \\ 11).\\]\n\n\nExample 6.12 Consider the permutation \\(f = (1 \\; 7 \\; 9 \\; 3)(2 \\; 4 \\; 8 \\; 6) \\in S_9\\). Pre-multiply \\(f\\) by a transposition \\((i \\; j)\\) (and note the effect this has on the orbits of \\(f\\)) where\n\n\\(i\\) and \\(j\\) come from the same orbit of \\(f\\), e.g. \\((i \\; j) = (4 \\; 8)\\).\n\n\\[(4 \\ 8)f = (1 \\ 7 \\ 9 \\ 3) (2 \\ 8 \\ 6) (4) = (1 \\ 7 \\ 9 \\ 3) (2 \\ 8 \\ 6).\\] Notice that \\(f\\) has \\(3\\) orbits and \\((4 \\ 8)f\\) has \\(4\\) obits.\n\n\\(i\\) and \\(j\\) come from different orbits of \\(f\\), e.g. \\((i \\; j) = (7 \\; 2)\\).\n\n\\[(7 \\ 2)f = (1 \\ 2 \\ 4 \\ 8 \\ 6 \\ 7 \\ 9 \\ 3).\\] In this case \\((7 \\ 2)f\\) has \\(2\\) orbits — one less than \\(f\\).\n\n\n\n\nLemma 6.1 Let \\(f \\in S_n, \\, (n \\geq 2),\\) and \\((i \\; j)\\) be a transposition in \\(S_n\\). Then the number of orbits of \\(f\\) and \\((i \\; j)f\\) differ by 1.\n\n\nProof. We first express \\(f\\) as a product of disjoint cycles, \\(c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_r\\) and consider two cases.\n\nCase 1:\n\n\\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are from distinct orbits of \\(f\\).\n\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) come from \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) respectively. Suppose \\(c_1 = (x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ \\ldots \\ x_{a})\\) and \\(c_2 = (y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \\ldots \\ y_b)\\). We may assume, again without loss of generality that that \\(i = x_1\\) and \\(j=y_1\\). Now consider: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n  (i \\ j) f &=& (x_1 \\ y_1)(x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ \\ldots \\ x_{a})(y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \\ldots \\ y_b)c_3 \\ldots c_r\\\\ &=& (x_1 \\ x_2 \\ldots \\ x_a \\ y_1 \\ y_2 \\ldots y_b)c_3 \\ldots c_r.\n  \\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nIt follows that \\((i \\ j)f\\) has one fewer orbit than \\(f\\),\n\n\nCase 2:\n\n\\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are from the same orbit of \\(f\\).\n\nWe may assume without loss of generality that \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) come from \\(c_1\\). Let \\(c_1 = (x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \\ldots \\ x_a)\\). We may assume that \\(i = x_1\\) and \\(j = x_d\\) for \\(1&lt; d \\le a\\) so that \\[c_1 = (i =x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \\ldots \\ x_d \\ \\ldots \\ x_a).\\] Then \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n(x_1 \\ x_d)f &=& (x_1 \\ x_d) (x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \\ldots \\ x_d \\ \\ldots \\ x_a) c_2 \\ldots c_r\\\\ &=& (x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \\ldots \\ x_{d-1})(x_d \\ x_{d+1} \\ \\ldots \\ x_{a}) c_2 \\ldots c_r.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] We see that \\(c_1\\) is split into two disjoint cycles — the number of orbits of \\((1 \\ j)f\\) is one more than \\(f\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 6.2 No permutation can be expressed both as a product of an even number of transpositions and as a product of an odd number of transpositions.\n\n\nProof. \n\nFirst we make the following observation. Let \\(\\tau_1, \\tau_2, \\ldots \\tau_r\\) be transpositions. Let \\(m\\) be the number of orbits of \\(\\tau_1 \\ldots \\tau_r \\id\\). By Lemma 6.1, if \\(r\\) is even, \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) have the same parity (that is they are either both even or both odd) and if \\(r\\) is odd, then \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) have different parities (one is even and the other is odd). This is easily seen since Lemma 6.1 says each time we multiply a permutation by a transposition we change the parity of the number of its orbit and the identity element has \\(n\\) orbits.\nNow let \\(f\\) be a permutation. Suppose there are transpositions \\(c_1, c_2 \\ldots, c_r, d_1, d_2, \\ldots d_s\\) such that \\(f\\) can be expressed as \\[f = c_1 c_2 \\ldots c_r = d_1 d_2 \\ldots d_s.\\] Rearranging, it follows that \\[d_s d_{s-1}\\ldots d_{1}c_rc_{r-1}\\ldots c_{1} = \\id\\] and so \\[d_s d_{s-1}\\ldots d_{1}c_rc_{r-1}\\ldots c_{1} \\id = \\id.\\] By our observation above, we must conclude that if \\(r + s\\) must be even. Since \\(d_s d_{s-1}\\ldots d_{1}c_rc_{r-1}\\ldots c_{1} \\id\\) has \\(n\\) orbits.\n\n\n\nDefinition 6.5 (Parity) A permutation is even or odd according to whether it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions or as an odd number of transpositions, respectively.\n\n\nExample 6.13  \n\nThe identity permutation \\(\\id \\in S_n\\) is an even permutation. This follows since \\(\\id = (i \\ j)(i \\ j)\\).\n\n\n\nTheorem 6.3 The number of even permutations in \\(S_n\\) is the same as the number of odd permutations in \\(S_n\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nLet \\(A_n\\) be the set of even permutations in \\(S_n\\). Notice that \\(S_n \\backslash \\{A_n\\}\\) is the set of odd permutations in \\(S_n\\). Let \\(\\tau\\) be any transposition in \\(S_n\\). Define a map \\(\\theta: A_n \\to S_n\\backslash A_n\\) by \\(\\theta(f) = \\tau f\\). Notice that by Lemma 6.1, for \\(f \\in A_n\\) \\(\\tau f \\in S_n \\backslash A_n\\) and so \\(\\theta\\) indeed maps elements of \\(A_n\\) into the set \\(S_n \\backslash A_n\\). We show that \\(\\theta\\) is injective and surjective.\n\nInjective:\n\nLet \\(f_1, f_2 \\in A_n\\) and suppose \\(\\theta(f_1) = \\theta(f_2)\\). This means that \\(\\tau f_1 = \\tau f_2\\), cancelling then yields that \\(f_1 = f_2\\).\n\nSurjective:\n\nLet \\(g \\in S_n\\backslash A_n\\). Then \\(\\tau g \\in A_n\\) by Lemma 6.1 again. Moreover, \\[\\theta( \\tau g) = \\tau (\\tau g) = (\\tau \\tau) g = g.\\] Therefore \\(\\theta\\) is surjective.\n\n\nThe map \\(\\theta\\) is therefore a bijection and so the number of even permutations in \\(S_n\\) must be the same as the number of odd permutations in \\(S_n\\).\n\n\nSince the product of two even permutations is even, and the identity permutation is even, we have, by Lemma 3.5, that the set of all even permutations of degree \\(n\\) forms a subgroup of \\(S_n\\) called the alternating group of degree \\(n\\) and denoted \\(A_n\\). Both \\(S_n\\) and \\(A_n\\) are very important groups and you will encounter them again if you take the third-year optional module Group Theory. At present it is sufficient to note that \\(A_4\\) (which has order 12 - think about it) is isomorphic to the group of rotational symmetries of a regular tetrahedron, which provided us with the smallest counterexample to the converse of Lagrange’s Theorem.",

    "section": "6.6 Cayley’s Theorem",
    "text": "6.6 Cayley’s Theorem\nConsider the following examples.\n\nExample 6.14 Notice that \\(S_1\\) has only one element. So, \\(S_1 \\cong \\Z_1\\) as there is only one group of order 1 (the trivial group containing only the identity). \\(S_2\\) has 2!=2 elements, so \\(S_2 \\cong \\Z_2\\) as there is only one group of order 2. What about \\(S_3\\)? This has 3!=6 elements, but there are two isomorphically distinct groups of order 6, namely \\(\\Z_6\\) and \\(D_3\\). It is easy to see that \\(S_3\\) is non-abelian so \\(S_3\\) has to be isomorphic to \\(D_3\\). However, a more direct and satisfying approach is as follows:\n\nConsider, as below, an equilateral triangle with vertices labelled with the numbers 1, 2 and 3 anticlockwise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach symmetry of the triangle induces a permutation of the vertices \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\). For example the symmetry \\(r_1\\) (see Example 2.1) has the effect:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus we have \\[r_1 \\mapsto \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}.\\]\nSimilarly we have,\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\ne &\\mapsto& \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\nr_2 &\\mapsto& \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 1 & 2\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\ns_1 &\\mapsto& \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 3 & 2\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\ns_2 &\\mapsto& \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 2 & 1\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\ns_3 &\\mapsto& \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 3\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nThis gives an isomorphism from \\(D_3\\) to \\(S_3\\). Clearly we have a bijection from \\(D_3\\) to \\(S_3\\) and it is easily verified that this bijection is also a homomorphism. For example, \\(r_1 \\circ s_1 = s_3\\) and \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 3 &1 \\end{pmatrix} \\circ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 3 &2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 1 &3 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\nNotice that a similar argument demonstrates that every dihedral group can be represented as a group of permutations. However, the example above is special — it is the only example where a dihedral group is isomorphism to a full symmetric group. When \\(n &gt;3\\), the dihedral group \\(D_n\\) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group.\n\n\nIt turns out, in fact, that every finite group is isomorphic to a subgroup of some symmetric group. Formally, if \\(|G| = n\\) then \\(G\\) is isomorphic to some subgroup of \\(S_n\\). This is what is known as Cayley’s Theorem and we prove this and study it in more detail in third-year Group Theory.\n\nTheorem 6.4 (Cayley’s Theorem) Every finite group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.\n\n\nProof. Omitted.\n\nWe finish this chapter with an interesting example: A ‘riffle’ shuffle consists of splitting a pack of cards in equal halves and then interlacing the cards from each half. In a perfect riffle a deck of 52 cards, numbered from 1 to 52 from the bottom up, would result in a deck with the cards numbered 1, 27, 2, 28, …. from the bottom up. How many perfect riffle shuffles are required before a deck returns to its original position? Does it matter if the halves are interlaced so that after one shuffle the order of the cards is 27, 1, 28, 2, …. ?\n\nSolution:\nWe consider this as a simple permutation. Let the cards be numbered sequentially from 1 to 52, starting with 1 at the bottom of the pack; thus the card number, at this stage, will correspond to its position in the pack. Let the top row be the starting position and let the bottom row be the position that the respective card occupies after one perfect riffle:\n\\[f = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccc}1&27&2&28&3&29&4&30&5&31&6&32&7&33&8&34&9&35&10&36\\\\1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12&13&14&15&16&17&18&19&20\\end{array}\\right.\\] \\[\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccc}&11&37&12&38&13&39&14&40&15&41&16&42&17&43&18&44&19&45\\\\&21&22&23&24&25&26&27&28&29&30&31&32&33&34&35&36&37&38\\end{array}\\] \\[\\hspace{-5.9em}\\left.\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccccc}20&46& 21&47&22&48&23&49&24&50&25&51&26&52\\\\39&40&41&42&43&44&45&46&47&48&49&50&51&52\\end{array}\\right).\\]\nNow re-order so that the top row is sequential starting at 1 (our usual, two-row permutation representation). \\[f = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccc}1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12&13&14&15&16&17&18&19&20\\\\1&3&5&7&9&11&13&15&17&19&21&23&25&27&29&31&33&35&37&39\\end{array}\\right.\\] \\[\\hspace{2.5em}\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccc}21&22&23&24&25&26&27&28&29&30&31&32&33&34&35&36&37&38&39\\\\41&43&45&47&49&51&2&4&6&8&10&12&14&16&18&20&22&24&26\\end{array}\\] \\[\\hspace{-6.9em}\\left.\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccc}40& 41&42&43&44&45&46&47&48&49&50&51&52\\\\28&30&32&34&36&38&40&42&44&46&48&50&52\\end{array}\\right).\\]\nThen, using the usual method of writing a permutation as a product of disjoint cycles, we have that\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nf &=& (2\\; 3 \\; 5 \\; 9 \\; 17 \\;33 \\; 14 \\; 27) (4 \\; 7 \\; 13 \\; 25 \\; 49 \\; 46 \\; 40 \\; 28) (6 \\; 11 \\; 21 \\; 41 \\; 30 \\; 8 \\; 15 \\; 29)\\\\ &&(10 \\; 19 \\; 37 \\; 22 \\; 43 \\; 34 \\; 16 \\; 31)\n(12 \\; 23 \\; 45 \\; 38 \\; 24 \\; 47 \\; 42 \\; 32) (18 \\; 35)\\\\ && (20 \\; 39 \\; 26 \\; 51 \\; 50 \\; 48 \\; 44 \\; 36).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nHence, the period of \\(f\\) is lcm(8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8) = 8.\nUsing the same method to investigate the other arrangement following the first riffle:\n\\[f = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccc}27&1&28&2&29&3&30&4&31&5&32&6&33&7&34&8&35&9&36&10\\\\1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12&13&14&15&16&17&18&19&20\\end{array}\\right.\\] \\[\\hspace{2.5em}\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccc}37&11&38&12&39&13&40&14&41&15&42&16&43&17&44&18&45&19&46\\\\21&22&23&24&25&26&27&28&29&30&31&32&33&34&35&36&37&38&39\\end{array}\\] \\[\\hspace{-6.9em}\\left.\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}20&47&21&48&22&49&23&50&24&51&25&52&26\\\\40&41&42&43&44&45&46&47&48&49&50&51&52\\end{array}\\right).\\]\nNow re-order so that the top row is sequential starting at 1.\n\\[f = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccc}1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12&13&14&15&16&17&18&19&20\\\\2&4&6&8&10&12&14&16&18&20&22&24&26&28&30&32&34&36&38&40\\end{array}\\right.\\] \\[\\hspace{2.5em}\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccc}21&22&23&24&25&26&27&28&29&30&31&32&33&34&35&36&37&38&39\\\\42&44&46&48&50&52&1&3&5&7&9&11&13&15&17&19&21&23&25\\end{array}\\] \\[\\hspace{-6.9em}\\left.\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccc}40&41&42&43&44&45&46&47&48&49&50&51&52\\\\27&29&31&33&35&37&39&41&43&45&47&49&51\\end{array}\\right).\\]\nThen, using the usual method of writing a permutation as a product of disjoint cycles, we have that \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nf &=& (1 \\; 2 \\; 4 \\; 8 \\; 16 \\; 32 \\; 11 \\; 22 \\; 44 \\; 35 \\; 17 \\; 34 \\; 15 \\; 30 \\; 7 \\; 14 \\; 28 \\; 3 \\; 6 \\; 12 \\; 24 \\; 48 \\; 43 \\; 33 \\; 13 \\; 26 \\; 52 \\; 51 \\; 49 \\; 45 \\\\ && 37 \\; 21 \\; 42 \\; 31 \\; 9 \\; 18 \\; 36 \\; 19 \\; 38 \\; 23 \\; 46 \\; 39 \\; 25 \\; 50 \\; 47 \\; 41 \\; 29 \\; 5 \\; 10 \\; 20 \\; 40 \\; 27).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] Hence, the period of \\(f\\) is now 52.",

    "text": "6.7 Problem Sheet 6\nFor Week 8; covers Chapter 6.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6.1\n\n\nLet \\((G_1,\\circ)\\) and \\((G_2,*)\\) be groups and \\(\\theta:G_1 \\rightarrow\nG_2\\) be an injective homomorphism. For each of the following statements, either prove that it is true or provide a counter-example:\n\nIf \\((G_1,\\circ)\\) is abelian, then \\((G_2,*)\\) is abelian.\nIf \\((G_2, *)\\) is abelian, then \\((G_1,\\circ)\\) abelian.\n\nBeware spurious ‘proofs’!\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 6.1\n\n\n\n\nSolution 6.1\n\n\n\nThis statement is false, but it is easy to give what appears to be a ‘proof’ that it is true. Consider the following ‘proof’: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\text{Let} \\; x, y \\in G_1. \\;\\text{Then}, \\; \\theta(x)*\\theta(y) &=& \\theta(x \\circ y) \\hspace{1.5cm} \\theta \\; \\text{is a homomorphism}\\\\\n&=& \\theta(y \\circ x) \\hspace{1.5cm} G_1 \\; \\text{is abelian}\\\\\n&=& \\theta(y) * \\theta(x) \\hspace{1cm} \\theta \\; \\text{is a homomorphism}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] Hence, \\(G_2\\) is abelian.\nThe problem with this proof is that it only proves that the image of \\(G_1\\) in \\(G_2\\) is abelian. If \\(G_1\\) does not map onto the whole of \\(G_2\\) then we can say nothing about the commutativity, or otherwise, of those elements of \\(G_2\\) that are not mapped onto from \\(G_1\\), and in this case we are not told that \\(\\theta\\) is surjective.\nAs stated, this statement is false. For a counterexample let \\(G_1\\) be the subgroup of \\(D_3\\) consisting of the identity and the rotations and let \\(G_2\\) be the whole of \\(D_3\\). Let \\(\\theta\\) be the identity mapping from \\(G_1\\) to \\(G_2\\), that is \\(\\theta : \\{e, r_1, r_2\\} \\maps D_3\\) defined by \\(\\theta(e)=e\\), \\(\\theta(r_1)=r_1\\), and \\(\\theta(r_2)=r_2\\). Clearly \\(\\theta\\) is injective and a homomorphism, but whilst \\((\\{e, r_1, r_2\\}, \\circ)\\) is abelian \\(D_3\\) is not abelian.\nThis statement is true and the proof is as follows: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\text{Let} \\; x, y \\in G_1. \\;\\text{Then}, \\; \\theta(x \\circ y) &=& \\theta(x) * \\theta (y) \\hspace{1.5cm} \\theta \\; \\text{is a homomorphism}\\\\\n&=& \\theta(y) * \\theta (x) \\hspace{1.5cm} G_2 \\; \\text{is abelian}\\\\\n&=& \\theta(y \\circ x) \\hspace{2cm} \\theta \\; \\text{is a homomorphism}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] Hence, \\(G_1\\) is abelian (since \\(\\theta\\) is injective).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6.2\n\n\nRecall that the kernel of the homomorphism is a subgroup of the domain. Recall, also, that we said in lectures that the size of the image of a homomorphism equals the size of the domain divided by the size of its kernel. That, of course, related to examples where both the domain and the image were finite. What happens if we now consider examples where infinity plays a part? So, investigate the kernels of the following homomorphisms in light of the above relationship:\n\n\\(\\theta : (\\Z, +) \\rightarrow \\Z_n\\) defined by \\(\\forall a \\in \\Z, \\; \\theta(a) = a \\modu n)\\),\n\\(\\phi : GL(2, \\R) \\rightarrow \\R \\backslash \\{0\\}\\) defined by \\(\\forall A \\in GL(2, \\R),\\; \\phi(A) = |A|\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 6.2\n\n\n\n\nSolution 6.2\n\n\nFirst we need to be reminded of the definition of the kernel of a homomorphism. In simple terms, if there is a homomorphism from a group \\(G_1\\) into a group \\(G_2\\) then the kernel of that homomorphism is the subset of elements of \\(G_1\\) that map, under the homomorphism, to the identity element in \\(G_2\\). Formally:\nLet \\(\\phi\\) be a group homomorphism from a group \\(G_1\\) to a group \\(G_2\\) and let \\(e_2\\) be the identity in \\(G_2\\). Then, the kernel of \\(\\phi\\) is denoted and defined by \\[\\text{ker} \\; (\\phi) = \\{x \\in G \\where \\phi(x)= e_2\\}.\\] Recall that the kernel of the homomorphism is a subgroup of the domain. Recall, a,so, that we said in lectures that the size of the image of a homomorphism equals the size of the domain divided by the size of its kernel. That, of course, related to examples where both the domain and the image were finite. What happens if we now consider examples where infinity plays a part?\n\nNote that the function is mapping into \\(\\zn\\) and so the identity element is 0 \\(\\modu n)\\) (since the operation in \\(\\zn\\) is addition modulo \\(n\\)). Clearly the domain is infinite. In addition, the kernel of \\(\\theta\\) must be infinite since, for any \\(n \\in \\Z\\), there is an infinite number of integers congruent to 0 modulo \\(n\\) for any given \\(n\\) (these will be of the form \\(kn\\) where \\(k \\in \\Z\\)). On the other hand, the image of \\(\\theta\\) is finite as \\(\\zn = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}\\) and so contains \\(n\\) elements.\nSo, here, we have \\[n = \\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}.\\]\nIn this instance \\(\\phi\\) is mapping into \\(\\rwz\\). It is implicit that the binary operation is multiplication and that the identity is 1. Therefore, the kernel of this homomorphism is the set of all \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrices that have determinant 1. Obviously the domain of the homomorphism, that is \\(GL(2, \\R)\\), is infinite, as is the image \\(\\rwz\\). But what about the kernel? A little thought should reveal that this is also infinite since every matrix of the form \\(\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\k&1\\end{array}\\right)\\), where \\(k \\in \\R\\), has determinant 1.\nSo, here, we have \\[\\infty = \\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6.3\n\n\nLet \\(f = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc}1&2&3&4&5\\\\2&3&5&1&4 \\end{array} \\right)\\) and \\(g = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc}1&2&3&4&5\\\\4&3&2&1&5 \\end{array} \\right)\\). Calculate \\(g \\circ f\\), \\(f \\circ g\\), \\(f^2\\), and \\(g^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 6.3\n\n\n\n\nSolution 6.3\n\n\n\\(g \\circ f\\):\nRemember that the operation here is function composition, so we apply the second function, \\(f\\), first. Consider the number 1. Permutation $ f$ takes 1 to 2 and then permutation \\(g\\) takes 2 to 3. Hence, the composite function \\(g \\circ f\\) takes 1 to 3. Now consider the number 2. Permutation \\(f\\) takes 2 to 3 and then \\(g\\) takes 3 to 2, so \\(g \\circ f\\) takes 2 to 2. Similarly we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nf(3) = 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g(5) = 5 \\quad \\text{so} \\quad (g \\circ f)(3) = 5\\\\\nf(4) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g(1) = 4 \\quad \\text{so} \\quad (g \\circ f)(4) = 4\\\\\nf(5) = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g(4) = 1 \\quad \\text{so} \\quad (g \\circ f)(5) = 1\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] This gives the composite permutation \\[g \\circ f = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc}1&2&3&4&5\\\\3&2&5&4&1 \\end{array} \\right)\\]\n\\(f \\circ g\\):\nIn this case we apply \\(g\\) first and then \\(f\\). Consider the number 1. Permutation \\(g\\) takes 1 to 4 and then permutation \\(f\\) takes 4 to 1. Hence, the composite function \\(f \\circ g\\) takes 1 to 1. Now consider the number 2. Permutation \\(g\\) takes 2 to 3 and then \\(f\\) takes 3 to 5, so \\(f \\circ g\\) takes 2 to 5. Similarly we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\ng(3) = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(2) = 3 \\quad \\text{so} \\quad (f \\circ g)(3) = 3\\\\\ng(4) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(1) = 2 \\quad \\text{so} \\quad (f \\circ g)(4) = 2\\\\\ng(5) = 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(5) = 4 \\quad \\text{so} \\quad (f \\circ g)(5) = 4\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] This gives the composite permutation \\[f \\circ g = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc}1&2&3&4&5\\\\1&5&3&2&4 \\end{array} \\right)\\]\n\\(f^{2}\\):\nNote that \\(f^{2} = f \\circ f\\). Now, \\(f\\) maps 1 to 2 and then 2 to 3, so \\(f^2\\) maps 1 to 3. Similarly, \\(f^2(2)=5\\), \\(f^2(3)=4\\), \\(f^2(4)=2\\), and \\(f^2(5)=1\\), so \\[f^{2} = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc}1&2&3&4&5\\\\3&5&4&2&1 \\end{array} \\right).\\]\n\\(g^2\\):\nNote that \\(g^{2} = g \\circ g\\). Now, \\(g\\) maps 1 to 4 and then 4 to 1, so \\(g^2\\) maps 1 to 1. Similarly, \\(g^2(2)=2\\), \\(g^2(3)=3\\), \\(g^2(4)=4\\), and \\(g^2(5)=5\\), so \\[g^{2} = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc}1&2&3&4&5\\\\1&2&3&4&5 \\end{array} \\right).\\] Notice that this is the identity permutation, so if \\(g^2 = \\text{id}\\) we must have that \\(g\\) is self-inverse, that is \\(g = g^{-1}\\). This is easy to see from the two-row representation of \\(g\\) (turn it upside-down and you get the same permutation).\nWe could have performed all of the above calculations by first expressing \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) as disjoint cycles. It is good practise to do this.\nAs disjoint cycles we have that \\(f = (1 \\; 2 \\; 3 \\;5 \\; 4)\\) and \\(g = (1 \\; 4) (2 \\; 3)\\). Then:\n\n\\(g \\circ f = (1 \\; 4) (2 \\; 3) (1 \\; 2 \\; 3\\;  5 \\; 4) = (1 \\; 3 \\; 5) (2) (4) = (1 \\; 3 \\; 5)\\);\n\\(f \\circ g = (1 \\; 2 \\; 3 \\; 5 \\; 4) (1 \\; 4) (2 \\; 3) = (1) (2 \\; 5 \\; 4)(3) = (2 \\; 5 \\; 4)\\);\n\\(f^2 = (1 \\; 2 \\; 3 \\; 5 \\; 4) (1 \\; 2 \\; 3 \\; 5 \\; 4) = (1 \\; 3 \\; 4 \\; 2 \\; 5)\\);\n\\(g^2 = (1 \\; 4) (2 \\; 3) (1 \\; 4) (2 \\; 3) = (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) = \\text{id}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6.4\n\n\nFor each of the following permutations\n\nwrite the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles,\nstate the number of orbits of the permutation,\nfind the inverse permutation,\nwrite the permutation as a product of transpositions in two different ways,\nstate whether the permutation is even or odd,\nfind the period of the permutation.\n\n\n\\(\\alpha = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12\\\\7&12&8&6&9&11&3&1&2&10&4&5 \\end{array} \\right) \\in S_{12}\\).\n\\(\\beta = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12\\\\6&12&10&9&3&11&7&5&1&8&4&2 \\end{array} \\right) \\in S_{12}\\).\n\\(\\gamma = (1 \\; 3 \\; 8 \\; 5) (2 \\; 9 \\; 3) (1 \\; 4\\; 3 \\; 7) (4 \\; 5 \\; 8 \\; 9) \\in S_9\\).\n\\(\\delta = (1 \\; 5 \\; 3 \\; 6) (6 \\; 3 \\; 2 \\; 1) (1 \\; 2 \\; 5) (3 \\; 5 \\; 7 \\; 1) (4 \\; 6 \\; 1 \\; 5) \\in S_8\\).\n\\(\\epsilon = (1 \\; 3 \\; 4) (3 \\; 2 \\; 1) (4 \\; 3 \\; 1) (5 \\; 4 \\; 3) (2 \\; 5 \\; 1) \\in S_5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 6.4\n\n\n\n\nSolution 6.4\n\n\n\n\\(\\alpha = (1 \\; 7 \\; 3 \\; 8) (2 \\; 12 \\; 5 \\; 9) (4 \\; 6 \\; 11) (10) = (1 \\; 7 \\; 3 \\; 8) (2 \\; 12 \\; 5 \\; 9) (4 \\; 6 \\; 11)\\). \\(\\alpha\\) has four orbits (we count singletons).\nTo find the inverse permutation we simply reverse the cyclic order of the elements in of the orbits, so \\(\\alpha^{-1} = (8 \\; 3 \\; 7 \\; 1) (9 \\; 5 \\; 12 \\; 2) (11, \\; 6 \\; 4)\\).\nWe use the two different rules for writing permutations as transpositions (see lecture notes), remembering that we apply the rule to each individual cycle in turn. This gives\n\\[\\alpha = (1 \\; 7) (7 \\; 3) (3 \\; 8) (2 \\; 12) (12 \\; 5) (5 \\; 9) (4 \\; 6) (6 \\; 11)\\] or \\[\\alpha = (1 \\; 8) (1 \\; 3) (1 \\; 7) (2 \\; 9) (2 \\; 5) (2 \\; 12) (4 \\; 11) (4 \\; 6).\\]\nAs the permutation can be expressed as the product of eight transpositions it is an even permutation. [Note we could have deduced that from the fact that it has an even number of orbits of even length.]\nWe find the period of a permutation from the lowest common multiple of the lengths of the disjoint cycles (orbits).

Hence the period of \\(\\alpha\\) is lcm(4, 3) = 12.\n\\(\\beta = (1 \\; 6 \\; 11 \\; 4 \\; 9) (2 \\; 12) (3 \\; 10 \\; 8 \\; 5) (7) = (1 \\; 6 \\; 11 \\; 4 \\; 9) (2 \\; 12) (3 \\; 10 \\; 8 \\; 5)\\).\n\\(\\beta\\) has four orbits.\n\\(\\beta^{-1} = (9 \\; 4 \\; 11 \\; 6 \\; 1) (12 \\; 2) (5 \\; 8 \\; 10 \\; 3)\\).\nAs a product of transpositions we have \\[\\beta = (1 \\; 6) (6 \\; 11) (11 \\; 4) (4 \\; 9) (2 \\; 12) (3 \\; 10) (10 \\; 8) (8 \\; 5)\\] or \\[\\beta = (1 \\; 9) (1 \\; 4) (1 \\; 11) (1 \\; 6) (2 \\; 12) (3 \\; 5) (3 \\; 8) (3 \\; 10).\\] This is an even permutation.\nThe period of \\(\\beta\\) is lcm(5, 2, 4) = 20.\n\\(\\gamma = (1 \\; 4) (2 \\; 9) (3 \\; 7) (5) (6) (8)= (1 \\; 4) (2 \\; 9) (3 \\; 7)\\). \\(\\gamma\\) has six orbits.\nThe disjoint cycles are already a product of transpositions, so there is only one way of writing these, namely \\((1 \\; 4) (2 \\; 9) (3 \\; 7)\\). This is an odd permutation.\nThe period of \\(\\beta\\) is lcm(2, 2, 2) = 2.

Also, for a permutation in \\(S_n\\) the disjoint cycles (including singletons) must contain precisely the \\(n\\) elements upon which the permutation acts. So in \\(S_{15}\\) we need to maximise the lowest common multiple of numbers from 1 to 15 that add up to 15. For example, if we have cycle lengths of 2, 3 and 10 (total 15) this permutation has a period of lcm(2, 3, 5) = 30. We can beat this with cycle lengths of, say, 7 and 8 since lcm(7, 8) = 56. The maximum period occurs when the cycle lengths add up to 15 but each is pairwise co-prime with the others. So \\(3 + 5 + 7 = 15\\) and lcm(3, 5, 7) = 105. An example of a permutation in \\(S_{15}\\) with period 105 is \\((1 \\; 2 \\; 3) (4 \\; 5 \\; 6 \\; 7 \\; 8) (9 \\; 10 \\; 11 \\; 12 \\; 13 \\; 14 \\; 15)\\).",

    "text": "7.1 Structure of Cyclic Groups\nWe start by considering the structure of cyclic groups and, in particular, by proving that all cyclic groups are abelian. Recall that a group \\(G\\) is cyclic if and only if it contains at least one element \\(a\\) such that \\(G=\\langle a \\rangle=\\{a^i : i \\in \\Z\\}\\).\nThe following theorem tells us that there is, essentially, only one cyclic group of any given order. This is an extension of Theorem 5.1 which said that two cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic.\nRecall that in Chapter 4 we proved, by a simple application of Lagrange’s Theorem, that every group of prime order is cyclic. We may now conclude that every group of order a prime, \\(p\\), is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_p\\). Thus we now have a complete classification for groups of prime order. We now need to extend this to abelian groups of any given order. We begin with the following theorem.",

    "text": "Theorem 7.1 Every cyclic group is abelian.\n\n\nProof. \n\nLet \\(G\\) be a cyclic group and \\(a \\in G\\) be a generator. Let \\(x,y \\in G\\). There are \\(i,j \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(x = a^{i}\\) and \\(y= a^{j}\\). Therefore: \\[xy = a^{i}a^{j} = a^{i+j} = a^{j+i} = a^{j}a^{i} = yx.\\]\nIt follows that \\(G\\) is abelian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis says that if a group is cyclic, then it must be abelian. The converse is not necessarily true; an abelian group does not have to be cyclic.\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 7.2 Let \\(G\\) be a cyclic group with generator \\(a\\). Then,\n\nif \\(G\\) is infinite, \\(G \\cong (\\Z, +)\\);\nif \\(G\\) is finite and of order \\(n\\), then \\(G \\cong \\Z_n\\).\n\n\n\nProof. \n\nLet \\(a \\in  G\\) be a generator for \\(G\\).\n\nDefine a map \\(\\theta: G \\to \\Z\\) by \\(\\theta(a^{i}) = i\\). We note firstly that \\(\\theta\\) is well-defined, since all the integer powers of \\(a\\) are distinct as \\(a\\) has infinite order. Clearly \\(\\theta\\) is bijective. It remains to see that \\(\\theta\\) is a homomorphism. Let \\(i,j \\in \\Z\\), then \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\theta(a^{i}a^{j}) &=& \\theta(a^{i+j})\\\\\n                   &=& i+j\\\\\n                   &=& \\theta(a^{i}) + \\theta(a^{j}).\n      \\end{eqnarray*}\\] It follows that \\(\\theta\\) is a bijective homomorphism and so \\(\\theta\\) is an isomorphism.\nWe note that the order of \\(a\\) is also \\(n\\). In particular, \\(a^{0}, a^{1},\\ldots, a^{n-1}\\) are the distinct elements of \\(G\\). Define a map \\(\\theta: G \\to \\Z_{n}\\) by \\(\\theta(a^{i}) = i\\) for all \\(0 \\le i \\le n-1\\). Then \\(\\theta\\) is a bijection. It remains to see that \\(\\theta\\) is a homomorphism: let \\(a^{i},a^{j} \\in G\\), \\(0 \\le i,j \\le n-1\\), then \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\theta(a^{i}a^{j}) &=& \\theta(a^{i \\oplus_{n} j}) \\\\\n                    &=& i \\oplus_n j \\\\\n                    &=& \\theta(a^{i})\\oplus_n \\theta(a^{j}).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] It follows that \\(\\theta\\) is a homomorphism and so an isomorphism.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 7.3 Any subgroup of a cyclic group is also cyclic.\n\n\nProof. \n\nLet \\(G\\) be a cyclic group with generator \\(a\\). Let \\(H\\) be a subgroup of \\(G\\). If \\(H\\) is the trivial subgroup \\(\\{e\\}\\), then clearly \\(H\\) is cyclic generated by \\(e\\). Therefore we may assume that \\(H\\) is not the trivial subgroup.\nLet \\(i \\in \\Z\\), \\(i &gt;0\\) be minimal such that \\(a^{i} \\in H\\). (We note that \\(i\\) exists since \\(H\\) is not trivial.) Let \\(x \\in H\\) be any other element. There is a \\(j \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(x = a^{j}\\). There are \\(q, r \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(j = qi + r\\) where \\(0 \\le r &lt;i\\). Notice \\(a^{r} = a^{j}a^{-qi} \\in H\\), as \\(H\\) is closed under products, \\(a^{j} \\in H\\) and \\(a^{-qi} = (a^{-i})^{q} \\in H\\). However as \\(r &lt;i\\), it must follows that \\(r = 0\\) (since \\(i&gt;0\\) is minimal such that \\(a^{i} \\in H\\)). We conclude that \\(a^{j}a^{-qi} =e\\) and so \\(a^{j} = (a^{i})^{q}\\).\nIt follows that every element of \\(H\\) is a power of \\(a^{i}\\) and \\(H\\) is cyclic and generated by \\(a^{i}\\).\n\n\n\nTheorem 7.4 Let \\(G\\) be a cyclic group of order \\(n\\) with generator \\(a\\), and let \\(1 \\leq m&lt;n\\). Then \\(\\langle a^m \\rangle = \\langle a^d \\rangle\\) where \\(d\\) is the greatest common divisor of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nIt is clear that \\(\\gen{a^{m}} \\subseteq \\gen{a^{d}}\\) since \\(m =ld\\) for some \\(l \\in \\Z\\) and so \\(a^{m} = (a^{d})^{l}\\).\nSince \\(d = \\gcd(m,n)\\) there are \\(u,v \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(d = um + vn\\). It follows that \\[a^{d} = a^{um+vn} =  a^{um} a^{vn} = (a^{m})^{u}(a^{n})^{v} = a^{mu}.\\] Therefore \\(a^{d} \\in \\gen{a^{m}}\\).\nWe conclude that \\(\\gen{a^{d}} = \\gen{a^{m}}\\).\n\n\n\nExample 7.1 Consider the cyclic subgroups of \\(\\Z_{12}\\).\n\nThe distinct divisors of 12 are \\(1,2,3,4,5,6,12\\).

It follows that \\(\\gcd(38,28) = 2\\). Therefore \\(\\gen{28} = \\gen{2}\\). It follows that the elements of \\(\\gen{28}\\) are\n\\[\\{0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36\\}.\\]\n\n\n\nCorollary 7.1 If \\(a\\) is a generator of a cyclic group \\(G\\) of order \\(n\\), then the other generators of \\(G\\) are the elements of the form \\(a^r\\) where \\(r\\) is relatively prime to \\(n\\).\n\n\nExample 7.3  \n\nWrite down all of the generators of \\(\\Z_{15}\\).\n\nThe generators are the elements of \\(\\Z_{15}\\) co-prime to 15, these are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13 and 14.\n\nWrite down all of the generators of \\(\\Z_{24}\\).\n\nThey are 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.\n\n\n\n\nLemma 7.1 Let \\(a \\in \\zn\\). Then the period of \\(a\\) in \\(\\zn\\) can be found by dividing \\(n\\) by the \\(\\gcd (a, n)\\).\n\n\nProof. Let \\(a \\in \\zn\\) and \\(d = \\greatcd (a, n)\\).\nFirst observe that \\(\\gen{a} = \\gen{d}\\) and so \\(a\\) and \\(d\\) have the same period in \\(\\Z_n\\) by Theorem 3.2. It therefore suffices to show that the period of \\(d\\) in \\(\\Z_{d}\\) is \\(\\frac{n}{d}\\).\nClearly \\(d \\frac{n}{d} = n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}\\). Therefore the period of \\(d \\in \\Z_{n}\\) is at most \\(\\frac{n}{d}\\). However for any \\(q \\in \\Z\\) with \\(0 \\le q &lt; \\frac{n}{d}\\), \\(qd &lt; n\\) and so \\(qd \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{n-1}\\). We conclude that the period of \\(d \\in \\Z_{n}\\) is precisely \\(\\frac{n}{d}\\). Thus, the period of \\(a \\in \\Z_{n}\\) is also \\(\\frac{n}{d}\\) as required.",

    "section": "7.2 Direct Products of Groups",
    "text": "7.2 Direct Products of Groups\nIn this section we demonstrate how we can use familiar groups as building blocks to construct larger groups. Recall that the Cartesian product of two sets, \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) say, is the set, denoted \\(S \\times T\\), consisting of all possible ordered pairs of elements where the first element of the pair comes from \\(S\\) and the second element comes from \\(T\\). We can extend this idea to any finite number of sets so, for example, we can take the product of three sets, \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), say, and then \\(A \\times B \\times C\\) will consist of ordered triples with the first element from \\(A\\), the second from \\(B\\) and the third from \\(C\\). So, for example, \\((3, 2, 4) \\in \\Z_5 \\times \\Z_6 \\times \\Z_7\\).\n\nDefinition 7.1 (Cartesian Product of Sets) Let \\(S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n\\) be sets. Then the Cartesian product of these sets is the set of all ordered \\(n\\)-tuples \\((a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)\\) where \\(a_i \\in S_i\\) for \\(i=1, 2, \\ldots, n\\). We denote the Cartesian product \\[S_1 \\times S_2 \\times \\ldots \\times S_n.\\]\n\nWe now let \\(G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_n\\) be groups (not necessarily distinct, nor abelian). We can form the Cartesian product of the sets of elements of these groups and then form a group by defining ‘multiplication component-wise’. Consider, for example, \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\). Its elements are \\((0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\\) and the binary operation is addition modulo 2 (this is what is meant by multiplication component-wise in this case). We can then construct the operation table as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\oplus_2&(0,0)&(0,1)&(1,0)&(1,1)\\\\\n\\hline\n(0,0)&(0,0)&(0,1)&(1,0)&(1,1)\\\\\n(0,1)&(0,1)&(0,0)&(1,1)&(1,0)\\\\\n(1,0)&(1,0)&(1,1)&(0,0)&(0,1)\\\\\n(1,1)&(1,1)&(1,0)&(0,1)&(0,0)\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nIt is clear that \\((\\Z_2\\times \\Z_2, \\oplus_2)\\) forms a group. It is an abelian group (this is clear from the multiplication table) but it is now cyclic — it has no element of order 4.\n\n\nTheorem 7.5 Let \\(G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_n\\) be groups. For \\((a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)\\) and \\((b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n)\\) in \\(G_1 \\times G_2 \\times \\ldots \\times G_n\\) we define \\[(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n) = (a_1b_1, a_2b_2, \\ldots, a_nb_n).\\] Then \\(G_1 \\times G_2 \\times \\ldots \\times G_n\\) forms a group, called the direct product of the groups \\(G_i\\) under this binary operation.\n\n\nProof. \n\nWe verify the group axioms hold.\n\nSince \\(G_1, G_2, \\ldots G_n\\) are groups, the binary operation on \\(G_1 \\times G_2 \\times \\ldots \\times G_n\\) is closed.\nLet \\((a_1,a_2, \\ldots, a_n), (b_1, b_2,\\ldots, b_n), (c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n) \\in G_2 \\times G_2 \\times \\ldots \\times G_n\\). Then \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n&&\\left((a_1,a_2, \\ldots, a_n)(b_1, b_2,\\ldots, b_n)\\right)(c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n) = \\\\ &&(a_1b_1,a_2b_2, \\ldots, a_nb_n) (c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n) = \\\\\n&& \\left((a_1b_2)c_1, (a_2b_2)c_2, \\ldots,(a_nb_n)c_n\\right) = \\\\\n&& \\left(a_1(b_2c_1), a_2(b_2c_2), \\ldots,a_n(b_nc_n)\\right) = \\\\\n&& (a_1,a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\left(b_1c_1, b_2c_2, \\ldots, b_nc_n\\right)=\\\\\n&&  (a_1,a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\left((b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n)(c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n)\\right).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] The binary operation is associative.\nLet \\(e_i\\) be the identity element of \\(G_i\\) for all \\(1 \\le i \\le n\\). Then \\((e_1,e_2, \\ldots, e_n)\\) is the identity element of \\(G_1 \\times G_2 \\times \\ldots \\times G_n\\).\nLet \\((a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_n) \\in G_1 \\times G_2 \\times \\ldots \\times G_n\\), then \\((a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n)^{-1} = (a_1^{-1},a_2^{-1},\\ldots,a_{n}^{-1}) \\in G_1 \\times G_2 \\times \\ldots \\times G_n\\).\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.4  \n\nLet \\(G_1 = \\Z_2\\) and \\(G_2 = D_3\\). Then \\(G_1 \\times G_2 = \\Z_2 \\times D_3\\) has order \\(12\\) and its elements are: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n&&(0,e),(0,r_1),(0,r_2),(0,s_1),(0,s_2),(0,s_3)\\\\\n&&(1,e),(1,r_1),(1,r_2),(1,s_1),(1,s_2),(1,s_3).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nWe compute products component wise. For example: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n(1,r_1)(0,s_2) &=& (1 + 0, r_1 \\circ s_2) = (1, s_1) \\\\\n(0,s_2)(1,r_1) &=& (0+1, s_2\\circ r_1) = (1,s_3).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] Notice that the group is not abelian (precisely because \\(D_3\\) is not abelian.)\nLastly, observe that \\[\\{(x,e): x \\in \\Z_2\\} = \\{(0,e),(1,e)\\}\\] is a subgroup of \\(\\Z_2 \\times D_3\\) isomorphic to \\(\\Z_2\\). Similarly, \\[\\{(0, y): y \\in D_3\\} = \\{(0,e),(0,r_1),(0,r_2),(0,s_1),(0,s_2),(0,s_3)\\}\\] is a subgroup of \\(\\Z_2 \\times D_3\\) isomorphic to \\(D_3\\).\n\n\n\nReminder\nLet \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) be integers. Recall that the largest positive integer that divides both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) is known as the greatest common divisor of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) and is denoted \\(\\greatcd (m, n)\\). For example, \\(\\greatcd (12, 15) = 3\\). We shall be particularly interested in cases where the greatest common divisor of two integers is 1. In this case we refer to the integers as being relatively prime. It is important to note that even if two integers are relatively prime, neither of them needs to be prime; for example, \\(\\greatcd (8, 9)=1\\), so 8 and 9 are relatively prime, though neither is a prime number. Recall, also, that the lowest common multiple of two integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). This is denoted \\(\\lowcm (m, n)\\). Now, let \\(m, n \\in \\Z\\). Then \\(mn = \\greatcd (m, n) \\times \\lowcm (m, n)\\). \\[e.g. \\qquad \\greatcd (6, 9) = 3, \\qquad \\lowcm (6, 9) = 18 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad 6 \\times 9 = 3 \\times 18 = 54.\\] So \\(\\lowcm (m, n) = mn\\) if and only if \\(\\greatcd (m, n) = 1\\) if and only if \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime.\n\nLemma 7.2 Let \\((a_1, a_2) \\in G_1 \\times G_2\\). If \\(a_i\\) is of finite period \\(r_i\\) in \\(G_i\\) then the period of \\((a_1, a_2)\\) in \\(G_1 \\times G_2\\) is equal to the lowest common multiple of \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nLet \\(l = \\lcm(r_1,r_2)\\). Then there are \\(s_1, s_2 \\in \\N\\) such that \\(r_1s_1 = l\\) and \\(r_2 s_2 = l\\). It follows that \\[(a_1,a_2)^{l} = \\left(a_1^l, a_2^l\\right) = \\left(a_1^{r_1s_1}, a_2^{r_2s_2}\\right) = (e_1, e_2)\\] where \\(e_i\\) is the identity element of \\(G_i\\) (\\(i=1,2\\)).\nNow let \\(m\\) be a positive integer such that \\((a_1,a_2)^{m} = (e_1, e_2)\\). Then \\(a_1^{m} = e_1\\) and \\(a_2^{m} = e_2\\). It follows that \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) both divide \\(m\\). Consequently, \\(l\\) divides \\(m\\) as well. Therefore \\(l\\) is the period of \\((a_1, a_2)\\).\n\n\n\nExample 7.5 In the following cases, find the period of the given element of the direct product group.\n\n\\((3, 7)\\) in the group \\(\\Z_{12} \\times \\Z_{21}\\).\n\nThe period of \\(3\\) in \\(\\Z_{12}\\) is \\(4\\) and the period of \\(7\\) in \\(\\Z_{21}\\) is \\(3\\). It follows that \\((3,7)\\) has period \\(12\\) in \\(\\Z_{12} \\times \\Z_{21}\\).\n\n\\((8, 4, 10)\\) in the group \\(\\Z_{12} \\times \\Z_{60} \\times \\Z_{24}\\).\n\nObserve that \\(8\\) has period \\(3 = \\frac{12}{\\gcd(8,12)}\\) in \\(\\Z_{12}\\), \\(4\\) has period \\(15 = \\frac{60}{\\gcd(60,4)}\\) in \\(\\Z_{60}\\) and \\(10\\) has period \\(12 = \\frac{24}{\\gcd(24,10)}\\) in \\(\\Z_{24}\\). Thus the period of \\((8,4,10)\\) in \\(\\Z_{12} \\times \\Z_{60} \\times \\Z_{24}\\) is \\(\\lcm(3,15,12) = 60\\).\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.6 Find the period of \\((3, 7, 12)\\) in the group \\(\\Z_{4} \\times \\Z_{10} \\times \\Z_{15}\\).\n\nSolution:\nWe first find the period of \\(3\\), \\(7\\) and \\(12\\) in \\(\\Z_4\\), \\(\\Z_{10}\\) and \\(\\Z_{15}\\) respectively:\nThe period of \\(3\\) in \\(\\Z_{4}\\) is \\(4\\) since \\(\\gcd(3,4) = 1\\); \\(7\\) has period \\(10\\) in \\(\\Z_{10}\\) by a similar argument, lastly \\(12\\) has period \\(5 = \\frac{15}{\\gcd(15,12)}\\) in \\(\\Z_{15}\\).\nThe period of \\((3,7,12)\\) in \\(\\Z_{4} \\times \\Z_{10} \\times \\Z_{15}\\) is the lowest common multiple of 4, 10 and 5 which is 20.\n\n\nWe now turn our attention to the question of whether or not a direct product of groups is cyclic. Consider the direct product group \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4\\). \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccccc}\n\\oplus&(0, 0)&(0, 1)&(0, 2)&(0, 3)&(1, 0)&(1, 1)&(1, 2)&(1, 3)\\\\\n\\hline\\\\\n(0, 0)&(0, 0)&(0, 1)&(0, 2)&(0, 3)&(1, 0)&(1, 1)&(1, 2)&(1, 3)\\\\\\\\\n(0, 1)&(0, 1)&(0, 2)&(0, 3)&(0, 0)&(1, 1)&(1, 2)&(1, 3)&(1, 0)\\\\\\\\\n(0, 2)&(0, 2)&(0, 3)&(0, 0)&(0, 1)&(1, 2)&(1, 3)&(1, 0)&(1, 1)\\\\\\\\\n(0, 3)&(0, 3)&(0, 0)&(0, 1)&(0, 2)&(1, 3)&(1, 0)&(1, 1)&(1, 2)\\\\\\\\\n(1, 0)&(1, 0)&(1, 1)&(1, 2)&(1, 3)&(0, 0)&(0, 1)&(0, 2)&(0, 3)\\\\\\\\\n(1, 1)&(1, 1)&(1, 2)&(1, 3)&(1, 0)&(0, 1)&(0, 2)&(0, 3)&(0, 0)\\\\\\\\\n(1, 2)&(1, 2)&(1, 3)&(1, 0)&(1, 1)&(0, 2)&(0, 3)&(0, 0)&(0, 1)\\\\\\\\\n(1, 3)&(1, 3)&(1, 0)&(1, 1)&(1, 2)&(0, 3)&(0, 0)&(0, 1)&(0, 2)\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nNotice that although \\(\\Z_2\\) and \\(\\Z_4\\) are both cyclic, \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4\\) is not cyclic — it has no element of period \\(8\\). For \\((a,b) \\in \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4\\), the period of \\(a\\) in \\(\\Z_2\\) is either 1 or 2 while the period of \\(b\\) (in \\(\\Z_4\\)) is one of 1, 2 or 4. Therefore the largest possible value of the lowest common multiple of the period of \\(a\\) and the period of \\(b\\) is \\(4\\). This means that the largest possible period of an element of \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4\\) is \\(4\\).\nNotice though that any element of \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4\\) can be written as a power of \\((1,0)\\) times a power of \\((0,1)\\).\n\nMore generally it is the case that the direct product of \\(n\\) cyclic groups, each of which is either \\(\\Z\\) or \\(\\Z_m\\) for some positive integer \\(m\\), is generated by the \\(n\\)-tuples \\[(1, 0,0 \\ldots, 0), (0, 1, 0, \\ldots, 0), \\ldots, (0, 0, 0, \\ldots, 1).\\] Such a direct product might also be generated by fewer elements; for example, \\(\\Z_3 \\times \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_{35}\\) is generated by the single element \\((1, 1, 1)\\).\n\nExample 7.7  \n\nConsider \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\). This is a group of order \\(6\\). We know that there is only one abelian group of order \\(6\\), namely \\(\\Z_6\\) and so \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\) must be cyclic. How do we find an element of order \\(6\\)in \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\)? Let \\((a,b) \\in \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\). Let \\(r\\) be the period of \\(a \\in \\Z_2\\) and \\(s\\) be the period of \\(b \\in \\Z_3\\). If \\((a,b)\\) is a generator of \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\) then \\(\\lcm(r,s) = 6\\). Thus if we can find an element \\(a \\in \\Z_2\\) of period \\(2\\) and an element \\(b \\in \\Z_3\\) of period \\(3\\), then \\((a,b)\\) will be a generator of \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\). We can chose \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b =1\\), the element \\((1,1)\\) is therefore a generator of \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\).\n\n\n\nExample 7.8  \n\nConsider the group \\(\\Z_3 \\times \\Z_3\\). Let \\((a,b) \\in \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_3\\). Notice that the possible periods of \\(a,b \\in \\Z_3\\) is \\(1\\) or \\(3\\). It follows that the largest possible value of the lowest common multiple of the period of \\(a\\) and the period of \\(b\\) is \\(3\\). There is no element of order 9 in \\(\\Z_3 \\times \\Z_3\\) — it is not a cyclic group.\n\n\nThe above examples are illustrations of the following general result.\n\nTheorem 7.6 The group \\(\\Z_m \\times \\zn\\) is cyclic (and, hence, isomorphic to \\(\\Z_{mn}\\)) if and only if \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime.\n\n\nProof. \n\nSuppose \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are co-prime. This means that the lcm of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) is \\(mn\\). Consider the element \\((1,1) \\in \\Z_{m} \\times \\Z_{n}\\). The period of \\(1 \\in \\Z_m\\) is \\(m\\) and the period of \\(1\\) in \\(\\Z_n\\) is \\(n\\), it follows that the period of \\((1,1) \\in \\Z_m \\times \\Z_n\\) is \\(mn = \\lcm(m,n)\\).\nSuppose \\(\\Z_m \\times \\Z_n\\) is cyclic. This means there is an element \\((a,b) \\in \\Z_m \\times \\Z_n\\) with period \\(mn\\). Let \\(l\\) be the period of \\(a \\in \\Z_m\\) and \\(p\\) be the period of \\(b\\) in \\(\\Z_n\\). Then \\(\\lcm(l,p) = mn\\). Notice that \\(l|m\\) and \\(p|n\\) by Theorem 4.1 therefore \\(l | \\lcm(m,n)\\) and \\(p | \\lcm(m,n)\\). Therefore \\(\\lcm(l,p) \\le \\lcm(m,n)\\). It follows that \\(\\lcm(m,n) = mn\\). Now if \\(\\gcd(m,n) \\ne 1\\), then \\(\\lcm(m,n)&lt; mn\\). We conclude that \\(\\gcd(m,n) =1\\) as required.\n\n\nThis theorem can be extended, by similar arguments, to a product of more than two factors. We state this result as a corollary without proof.\n\nCorollary 7.2 The group \\(\\Z_{m_1} \\times \\Z_{m_2} \\times \\ldots \\times \\Z_{m_n}\\) is cyclic (and, hence, isomorphic to \\(\\Z_{m_1m_2 \\ldots m_n}\\)) if and only if \\(m_1, m_2, \\ldots, m_n\\) are pairwise relatively prime.\n\n\nExample 7.9  \n\n\nThe group \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_5 \\times \\Z_9\\) is cyclic and isomorphic to \\(\\Z_{90}\\).\nThe group \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4\\) is not cyclic — \\(\\gcd(2,4) = 2\\).\nThe group \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_5 \\times \\Z_8\\) is not cyclic — \\(\\gcd(2,8) = 2\\).",

    "text": "7.3 Structure of Finite Abelian Groups\nWe said at the outset of the module that, in our study of Abstract Algebra, we would be interested in structure rather than content. It bears repeating, as we embark on the final part of our introduction to group theory and encounter another major structural theorem, just how far we have travelled from a set, an associated binary operation, and four simple axioms. Everything that we have encountered along the way, the entire edifice of structural theory that we have assembled, has emanated from those rudimentary foundations (and we have barely scratched the surface of the theory of groups). In the final section of this chapter we examine the structure of finite abelian groups and we begin by stating, without proof, the theorem that gives us complete structural information about all finite abelian groups.\n\nTheorem 7.7 (Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups) Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of the form \\[\\Z_{p_1^{r_1}} \\times \\Z_{p_2^{r_2}} \\times \\ldots \\times \\Z_{p_n^{r_n}}\\] where the \\(p_i\\) are primes, not necessarily distinct, and the \\(r_i\\) are positive integers.\n\nNote that the direct product is unique, except for the possible rearrangement of the factors. We can now classify (up to isomorphism) the abelian groups of any order according to the Fundamental Theorem.\n\nOrder 1:\n\n\nThere is only one group of order 1 (up to isomorphism), \\(\\Z_1\\).\n\n\nOrder 2:\n\n\nThere is only one group (up to isomorphism) of order \\(2\\) (2 is prime) and it is \\(\\Z_2\\)\n\n\nOrder 3:\n\n\nAs above only \\(\\Z_3\\).\n\n\nOrder 4:\n\n\nThere are two isomorphically distinct abelian groups of order \\(4\\), \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\) and \\(\\Z_4\\).\n\n\nOrder 5:\n\n\nOnly \\(\\Z_5\\) as \\(5\\) is prime.\n\n\nOrder 6:\n\n\nThere is only one abelian group (up to isomorphism) \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\) and \\(\\gcd(2,3) =1\\). Therefore \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\cong \\Z_6\\).\n\n\nOrder 7:\n\n\n\\(\\Z_7\\) as \\(7\\) is prime.\n\n\nOrder 8:\n\n\nThere are 3 abelian groups of order 8 up to isomorphism. We decompose \\(8 = 2^3 = 2 \\times 4\\) this gives isomorphically distinct groups \\[\\Z_8, \\Z_{2} \\times \\Z_4 \\text{ and } \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2.\\]\n\n\nOrder 9:\n\n\nThere are two isomorphically distinct abelian groups of order \\(9\\): \\(\\Z_9\\) and \\(\\Z_3 \\times \\Z_3\\).\n\n\nOrder 10:\n\n\nDecompose \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\). Notice that \\(\\gcd(2,5) = 1\\), therefore \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_5 \\cong \\Z_10\\). There is only one abelian group of order 10 — \\(\\Z_{10}\\).\n\n\nOrder 11:\n\n\nOnly \\(\\Z_{11}\\) as 11 is prime.\n\n\nOrder 12:\n\nWe have \\(\\Z_{12}\\) and\\(\\Z_{2} \\times \\Z_{2} \\times \\Z_3\\). We decompose \\[12 = 2^2 \\times 3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3.\\] Observe that \\(\\gcd(3,4) =1\\) therefore \\(\\Z_3 \\times \\Z_4 \\cong \\Z_12\\). Notice that \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\cong \\Z_6\\) (since \\(\\gcd(2,3) = 1\\)) and so \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\cong \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_6\\). However, \\(\\Z_6 \\times \\Z_2\\) is not in the form of TFTFAG (Theorem 7.7).\n\n\n\nExample 7.10 Classify, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, all of the abelian groups of order\n\n54\n\n\n\n\nIndicate which of the groups of order 54 listed is cyclic, and which is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_6 \\times \\Z_9\\).\n\nSolution:\n\nWe decompose \\(54= 2\\times 3^3\\). This gives isomorphically distinct groups\n\n\\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_{3^3}\\)\n\\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_{9}\\)\n\\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_3\\).\n\nThe group \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_{27}\\) is cyclic since \\(\\gcd(2,27) =1\\); the group \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_{9}\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_6 \\times \\Z_9\\) since \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\cong \\Z_6\\).\nWe decompose \\(600 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5^2\\). This gives isomorphically distinct groups\n\n\\(\\Z_8 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_{25}\\)\n\\(\\Z_8 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_5 \\times \\Z_5\\)\n\\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_{25}\\)\n\\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4 \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_5 \\times \\Z_5\\)\n\\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_{25}\\)\n\\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_5 \\times \\Z_5\\).\n\nObserve that \\(\\Z_8 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_{25}\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_{600}\\) since 8, 3 and 25 are pairwise relatively prime.\n\n\n\nWe are now in a position to prove that the converse of Lagrange’s Theorem is true for all abelian groups. We shall use the following lemma.\n\nLemma 7.3 If \\(d\\) divides \\(n\\), then \\(\\zn\\) contains a subgroup of order \\(d\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nLet \\(c = \\frac{n}{d}\\). Then \\(c |n\\) and so \\(\\frac{n}{\\gcd(c,n)} = \\frac{n}{c} = d\\). It follows that the element \\(c \\in \\Z_n\\) has period \\(d\\) and so \\(\\gen{c}\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\Z_n\\) of order \\(d\\).\n\n\n\nExample 7.11  \n\nConsider \\(\\Z_{12}\\). We note that \\(3 | 12\\) and \\(\\gen{4}\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\Z_{12}\\) of order \\(3\\). Indeed \\(\\gen{4} = \\{0,4,8\\}\\).\n\n\n\nTheorem 7.8 Let \\(G\\) be a finite abelian group of order \\(n\\) and let \\(d\\) be any divisor of \\(n\\). Then \\(G\\) has a subgroup of order \\(d\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nLet \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m\\) be primes and let \\(r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_m\\) be positive integers so that \\(p_1^{r_1}p_2^{r_2}\\ldots p_{m}^{r_m} = n\\) and \\(G \\cong \\Z_{p_1^{r_1}} \\times \\Z_{p_2^{r_2}} \\times \\ldots \\times \\Z_{p_m^{r_m}}\\).\nNow since \\(d\\) is a divisor of \\(n\\), there are positive integers \\(s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_m\\), where \\(0 \\le s_i \\le r_i\\), \\(i =1,2 \\dots, m\\), such that \\(d = p_1^{s_1}p_2^{s_2} \\ldots p_{m}^{s_m}\\).\nNow as \\(p_i^{s_i}|p_i^{r_i}\\) for all \\(1 \\le i \\le m\\), \\(\\Z_{p_i^{r_i}}\\) has a subgroup \\(H_i\\) of order \\(p_i^{s_i}\\). Notice that \\(H_1 \\times H_2 \\times \\ldots \\times H_m\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\Z_{p_1^{r_1}} \\times \\Z_{p_2^{r_2}} \\times \\ldots \\times \\Z_{p_m^{r_m}}\\). Moreover the order of \\(H_1 \\times H_2 \\times \\ldots \\times H_m\\) is precisely \\(p_1^{s_1}p_2^{s_2} \\ldots p_{m}^{s_m} = d\\). Therefore \\(\\Z_{p_1^{r_1}} \\times \\Z_{p_2^{r_2}} \\times \\ldots \\times \\Z_{p_m^{r_m}}\\) has a subgroup of order \\(d\\) and so \\(G\\) has a subgroup of order \\(d\\).\n\n\n\nExample 7.12 Consider \\(\\Z_9 \\times \\Z_4\\).\n\nNotice that \\(\\gcd(9,4) = 1\\) and so \\(\\Z_9 \\times \\Z_4\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_{36}\\). Indeed, \\(\\Z_9 \\times \\Z_{4}\\) is generated by \\((1,1)\\). If we want to find a subgroup of \\(\\Z_9\\) of order \\(3\\), then this corresponds to an element of order \\(3\\) (subgroups of cyclic groups are cyclic). Notice that \\((1,1)^{12} = (3,0)\\) has order 3. Indeed \\(\\gen{(3,0)} = \\{(0,0),(3,0),(6,0)\\}\\).\nA subgroup of order \\(6\\) corresponds to an element of order \\(6\\). Notice that \\((1,1)^{6} = (6,2)\\) is an element of order \\(6\\) (\\(6\\) has order \\(3\\) in \\(\\Z_9\\) and \\(2\\) has order \\(2\\) in \\(\\Z_4\\); \\(6 = \\lcm(2,3)\\)). We observe that \\[\\gen{(6,2)} = \\{(0,0),(6,2),(3,0),(0,2),(6,0),(3,2)\\} = \\gen{(3,0)} \\times \\gen {(0,2)}.\\]\n\n\n\nExample 7.13 Find two isomorphically distinct subgroups of \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_9\\) of order 12.\n\n\nNotice that \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_9  \\cong \\Z_{36}\\). Indeed \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_9 = \\gen{(1,1)}\\). We can find a subgroup of order 12 of \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_9\\) by finding an element of order 12 — \\((1,1)^3 = (3,3)\\) for instance. To extend this to a subgroup of \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_9\\) we simply take \\((0,3,3)\\). Thus \\(\\gen{(0,3,3)}\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_9\\) of order 12.\n\n\nHow do we find another isomorphically distinct subgroup? Notice that abelian groups of order 12 (up to isomorphism) are \\(\\Z_3 \\times \\Z_4 \\cong \\Z_{12}\\) or \\(\\Z_2 \\times  \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\). Thus to find a subgroup of order 12 isomorphically distinct from \\(\\Z_{12}\\), we need to find a subgroup isomorphic to \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\). We find the first \\(\\Z_2\\) factor from \\((1,0,0)\\), the second from \\((0,2,0)\\) and the \\(\\Z_3\\) factor from \\((0,0,3)\\). The second subgroup of order 12 is generated by these three elements: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n&&\\{(0,0,0), (1,0,0),(0,2,0),(0,0,3), \\\\\n  && (1,2,0),(1,0,3), (0,2,3),(0,0,6),\\\\\n  && (1,0,6),(0,2,6),(1,2,6),(1,2,3)\\}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.14 Find a subgroup of \\(\\Z_{14} \\times \\Z_{28}\\) of order 98.\n\nSolution\nNotice that \\(98 = 14 \\times 7\\). Thus to find a subgroup of order \\(98\\), we take \\(\\Z_{14} \\times H\\) where \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\Z_{28}\\) of order \\(7\\). We note that such a subgroup \\(H\\) exists since \\(7\\) divides \\(28\\) indeed we can take \\(H = \\gen{4}\\). Thus \\(\\Z_{14} \\times \\gen{4}\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\Z_{14} \\times \\Z_{28}\\) of order 98.\n\n\nTheorem 7.8 says that the converse of Lagrange’s Theorem is true for all finite abelian groups. But what about non-abelian groups? We know that, in general, the converse of Lagrange’s Theorem is false, but can we say more than that, in the sense that given a group of a given order we know the orders of the subgroups that it must contain? It turns out that we can say more and that is the subject of the following theorem, due to the Norwegian mathematician Peter Sylow. We state it without proof - for the proof you will have to take the third-year Group Theory module.\n\nTheorem 7.9 (Sylow’s First Theorem) Let \\(G\\) be a finite group of order \\(p^{\\alpha}m\\), where \\(p\\) is a prime not dividing \\(m\\). Then \\(G\\) has a subgroup of order \\(p^{\\beta}\\) for each integer \\(\\beta\\) such that \\(0 \\leq \\beta \\leq \\alpha\\).\n\nWe can see that this theorem tells us, for groups of a particular order, which order subgroups must exist. This is the closest that we can get to the converse of Lagrange’s Theorem.\n\nExample 7.15  \n\nLet \\(G\\) be a group of order \\(80 = 2^4 \\times 5\\). By Sylow’s First Theorem, \\(G\\) has subgroups of order 20, 2, 22, 23 and 24 and also a subgroups of order \\(5\\).\nNote that Sylow’s first theorem tells us nothing about the existence subgroups of order 20! We would have to dig further to determine if these exists or not.",

It therefore follows from Lemma 5.1 that we need ordered pairs where the first element has period 3 in \\(\\Z_3\\) and the second element has period 4 in \\(\\Z_4\\).

This says (if extended to more than two groups) that the period of \\((a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\in G_1 \\times G_2 \\times \\ldots \\times G_n\\) is the lowest common multiple of the periods of the individual \\(a_i\\) in their respective groups.\n\nIt is easy to see that 1 has period 4 in \\(\\Z_4\\) and, since 3 divides 9 exactly 3 times, that 3 has period 3 in \\(\\Z_{9}\\). Hence the period of (1, 3) in \\(\\Z_{4} \\times \\Z_{9} = \\text{lcm} (4, 3) = 12\\).\nWe need to find the period of 4 in \\(\\Z_{6}\\) and the period of 12 in \\(\\Z_{15}\\).\nNow, gcd(4, 6) = 2, so 4 has period \\(\\frac{6}{2} = 3\\) in \\(\\Z_{6}\\). Further gcd(12, 15) = 3, so 12 has period \\(\\frac{15}{3}=5\\) in \\(\\Z_{15}\\). Thus the period of (4, 12) in \\(\\Z_{6} \\times \\Z_{15}\\) = lcm(3, 5) = 15.\nWe need to find the period of 3 in \\(\\Z_{4}\\), the period of 4 in \\(\\Z_{5}\\), and the period of 2 in \\(\\Z_{9}\\).\nNote that in each case the element and the order of the group are relatively prime, so each of the given elements is a generator of its group.

It has order 6. Its proper subgroups are \\(\\{e, r_1, r_2 \\}\\), \\(\\{e, s_1 \\}\\), \\(\\{e, s_2 \\}\\), \\(\\{e, s_3 \\}\\) and \\(\\{ e\\}\\). All of these are cyclic.\nIn general, let \\(p, q\\) be prime. Then any group of order \\(pq\\) does not have non-cyclic subgroups since, by Lagrange’s Theorem, the proper subgroup orders can only be 1, \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) and we know that a group of prime order must be cyclic (obviously \\(\\{e\\}\\) is cyclic).\nFor infinitely many counter-examples, consider\n\n\\(D_p\\) : this has order \\(2p\\) and, of course, 2 and \\(p\\) are prime. Apart from \\(\\{e\\}\\), the only subgroups are \\(\\{e, r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_{p-1}\\}\\) and \\(\\{e, s_i \\}\\), where \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots, p\\).\n\\(\\Z_p \\times \\Z_p\\) : this cannot be cyclic since \\(p\\) and \\(p\\) cannot be relatively prime (gcd\\((p, p) = p\\), not 1). However, by the Fundamental Theorem, the subgroups must be of order \\(p\\), a prime, and hence cyclic.\nNote that \\(\\Z_p \\times \\Z_q\\) does not work because \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) must be relatively prime, so the group itself is cyclic.",

    "text": "8.1 Basic Concepts\nWe first state, as a reminder, some results from Algebra that we shall be using in this chapter (though the proofs are omitted and will not be required).\nThis last property means that the result obtained from doing the arithmetic first and then reducing modulo \\(m\\) is the same as the result obtained by reducing all of the numbers modulo \\(m\\) first and then doing the arithmetic.\nEuclid’s algorithm does two things of interest; it finds \\(\\greatcd (a, b)\\) and it enables us to express this greatest common divisor in the form \\((ma+nb)\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers.\nAn important property of \\(\\greatcd (a, b)\\) is that it is the smallest positive integer which can be expressed in the form \\(ma+nb\\); this result is a corollary to the following theorem.\nWe have already been using the following concept, but we repeat the formal definition.\nPairs of integers which are relatively prime include (7, 11), (8, 9), (12, 55), (-14, 65). Pairs of numbers which are not relatively prime include (6, 6), (15, 126), (-4, 18). When asked to prove something about relatively prime numbers we often use the following fact.\nOf fundamental importance in number theory is the class of numbers called prime numbers.\nWe refer to any positive integer that is not prime as composite. It is worth noting that if \\(p\\) is prime and \\(a\\) is any integer then the statement ‘\\(p\\) does not divide \\(a\\)’ is equivalent to saying that \\(p\\) and \\(a\\) are relatively prime (that is, \\(\\gcd (p, a)=1\\)). This is not the case if \\(p\\) is not prime, for example 10 does not divide 18 but 10 and 18 are not relatively prime. The importance of the class of primes is a consequence of the following theorem which we state without proof.\nThe uniqueness property of a prime decomposition may seem obvious, but it depends on the number system. Of course who would have to first make precise what the definition of a ‘prime’ is in the new number system. Consider the following example.",

What are the primes? We consider a positive integer \\(m \\in 2\\Z\\) prime if it is a not composite. Using this definition, the primes in \\(2\\Z\\) are \\[\\{2(2k+1): k \\ge 0\\} = \\{2,6,10,14 \\ldots \\}.\\]\nIt is clear that any element of \\(2\\Z\\) can be factorised as a product of primes. Indeed any element of \\(2\\Z\\) which is not prime is of the form \\(2^i m\\) for some \\(m \\in \\{2(2k+1): k \\ge 0\\} = \\{2,6,10,14 \\ldots \\}.\\)\nDo we have unique factorisation into primes? Take the number \\(36\\). This can be factorised either as \\(2 \\times 18\\) (both of which are prime with our definition) or as \\(6 \\times 6\\). Therefore we do not have unique factorisation.\nPerhaps we have the wrong definition. What if we stick with Definition 8.2 unchanged. With this definition of prime, the only element of \\(2\\Z\\) that is prime is \\(2\\). In this case we do not always have a factorisation into primes! Indeed any even integer that is not a power of \\(2\\) cannot be factorised as a product of primes in \\(2\\Z\\).\n\n\nTheorem 8.3 Let \\(a, b, m \\in \\Z\\). Then \\(\\greatcd (a, m) = 1\\) and \\(\\greatcd (b, m) = 1\\) if and only if \\(\\greatcd (ab, m) = 1\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nSuppose \\(\\gcd(a,m) = \\gcd(b,m) = 1\\). There are numbers \\(u,v,s,t \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(ua + vm= sb + tm =1\\). it now follows that \\((ua +vm)(sb + tm) =1\\). Expanding: \\[(ua +vm)(sb+tm) = (as)ab + m(atu + bsv + mtv) = 1.\\] It follows that \\(1\\) is the smallest positive integer in \\(\\{j(ab) + km : j,k \\in \\Z\\}\\). Therefore \\(\\gcd(ab,m) = 1\\) as required.\nOn the other hand suppose that \\(\\gcd(ab,m) = 1\\). Then \\(1\\) is the smallest positive integer in \\(\\{j(ab) + km : j,k \\in \\Z\\}\\). However, \\(\\{j(ab) + km : j,k \\in \\Z\\} \\subseteq \\{j'a + k'm : j',k' \\in \\Z\\}\\) and \\(\\{j(ab) + km : j,k \\in \\Z\\} \\subseteq \\{j'b + k'm : j',k' \\in \\Z\\}\\) . Therefore \\(1\\) is the smallest positive integer in each of \\(\\{j'a + k'm : j',k' \\in \\Z\\}\\) and \\(\\{j'b + k'm : j',k' \\in \\Z\\}\\). Therefore \\(\\gcd(a,m) = \\gcd(b,m) = 1\\) as required.",

    "text": "8.2 Reduced Residue System\nIn the Algebra module we explored the idea of congruence modulo some positive integer \\(n\\). It is worth reminding ourselves of the definition:\n\nDefinition 8.3 (Congruence) Let \\(n \\in \\N\\) and let \\(a,b \\in \\Z\\). We say \\(a\\) is congruent to \\(b\\) modulo \\(n\\), and write \\(a \\equiv b \\pmod{n}\\), to mean that \\(n \\divides (a-b)\\).\n\n\nExample 8.6  \n\n\n\\(15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\\) since \\(7| (15-1)\\);\nFor any integer \\(x\\) and any positive integer \\(n\\), \\(x \\equiv x \\pmod{n}\\) as \\(n | (x-x)\\).\n\n\n\nIt should be clear that for some given \\(n\\) there will be an infinite number of integers congruent to some fixed \\(a\\) modulo \\(n\\) and that we can group those integers together in a set. This is best illustrated by example.\n\nExample 8.7  \n\nLet \\(a = 2\\) and \\(n=5\\). Then:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n2 &\\equiv & 2 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n7 &\\equiv & 2 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n12 &\\equiv & 2 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n-3 &\\equiv & 2 \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\n\nThis leads to the following definition.\n\nDefinition 8.4 (Residue Class) Let \\(a, n\\) be integers, \\(n\\) positive. The residue class of \\(a\\) modulo \\(n\\) is denoted and defined by \\[[a]_n = \\{ m \\where m \\in \\Z, m \\equiv a \\modu n) \\} = \\{a+kn \\where k \\in \\Z \\}.\\]\n\n\nExample 8.8  \n\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n[1]_{5} &=& \\{\\ldots, -14,-9,-4,1,6,11,\\ldots\\} \\\\\n{[3]}_{7} &=& \\{\\ldots, -11,-4,3,10,17,\\ldots \\} \\\\\n{[0]}_{4} &=& \\{\\ldots, -12,-8,-4,0,4,8,\\ldots\\}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside\n\n\n\n\nConsider \\(H = \\{ 5k : k \\in \\Z\\}\\). This is a subgroup of \\((\\Z,+)\\). Notice that the left coset of \\(H\\) containing \\(1\\) is precisely the left coset\n\\[1H= \\{ 1 + h : h \\in H\\} = \\{ 5k + 1 : k \\in \\Z \\} = \\{\\ldots, -14,-9,-4,1,6,11,\\ldots\\}  = [1]_{5}.\\] So the left coset of \\(H\\) containing \\(1\\) is the residue class of \\(1\\) modulo \\(5\\). Notice that \\(H\\) is precisely \\([0]_{5}\\).\nThis is not a coincidence.\nLet \\(n\\) be a positive integer. Then \\(H = \\{ nk : k \\in \\Z \\}\\) is a subgroup of \\((\\Z,+)\\). For any integer \\(a \\in \\Z\\), the left coset \\(aH\\) of \\(H\\) containing \\(a\\) is precisely \\[\\{a + h \\in h \\in H\\} = \\{ a + nk : k \\in \\Z \\} = [a]_{n}.\\] Clearly \\(H = [0]_{n}\\).\n\n\n\nNotice that grouping together in sets the integers that are congruent to each other modulo some given \\(n\\) results in a partitioning of the integers such that each integer appears in exactly one of the residue classes. This partitioning of \\(\\Z\\) is a direct consequence of the fact that congruence modulo \\(n\\) is what is known as an equivalence relation on a set (more of this in third-year Group Theory).\n\nExample 8.9  \n\nWe take \\(n = 5\\). Then:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n[0]_{5} &=& \\{\\ldots, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, \\ldots\\} \\\\\n{[1]}_{5} &=& \\{\\ldots, -9, -4, 1, 6, 11, \\ldots\\} \\\\\n{[2]}_{5} &=& \\{\\ldots, -8, -3, 2, 7, 12, \\ldots\\} \\\\\n{[3]}_{5} &=& \\{\\ldots, -7, -2, 3, 8, 13, \\ldots\\} \\\\\n{[4]}_{5} &=& \\{\\ldots, -6, -1, 4, 9, 14, \\ldots\\}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\n\n\nLemma 8.1 Every integer is in exactly one of the residue classes \\([0]_n, [1]_n, \\ldots ,[n-1]_n\\) for a given positive integer \\(n\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nWe note that for \\(i\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(n-1\\) and \\(a \\in \\Z\\), \\(a \\in [i]_{n}\\) precisely when \\(a\\) has remainder \\(i\\) when divided by \\(n\\). Therefore every integer belongs to one of the residue classes \\([0]_n, [1]_n, \\ldots ,[n-1]_n\\).\n\n\nRecall that when we first introduced the concept of \\(\\Z_n\\), we defined this to be the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots , n-1 \\}\\). Strictly speaking, we should have defined \\(\\Z_n\\) as \\[\\Z_n = \\{[0]_n, [1]_n, [2]_n, \\ldots , [n-1]_n \\},\\] though for practical purposes we tend to use the former representation.\n\nDefinition 8.5 Let \\(A, B \\in \\Z_n\\) (so \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are residue classes, not numbers). Choose \\(a \\in A\\) and \\(b \\in B\\). Then\n\n\\(A+B = [a+b]_n\\) or, equivalently, \\([a]_n + [b]_n = [a+b]_n\\),\n\\(A \\times B = [ab]_n\\) or, equivalently, \\([a]_n[b]_n = [ab]_n\\).\n\n\nNote that this is a set with two binary operations defined on it. This forms the triple \\((\\Z_n, +, \\times)\\) and such a structure is called a ring, provided that certain axioms are satisfied. We shall see more of this in the final chapter.\n\nExample 8.10  \n\nTake \\(n = 5\\). Then \\(\\Z_{5} = \\{[0]_{5}, [1]_{5}, [2]_{5}, [3]_{5},[4]_{5}\\}\\). We compute\n\n\\([1]_{5} + 2_{5} = [1 + 2]_{5} = [3]_{5}\\);\n\\([3]_{5}[4]_{5} = [3\\times 4]_{5} =  [2]_{5}\\).\n\n\n\nIt is important to check that these operations are well defined. That is, if we were to choose different members of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), say \\(\\ap\\) and \\(\\bp\\) instead of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) respectively, does \\([\\ap + \\bp]_n = [\\ap]_n + [\\bp]_n\\) and does \\([\\ap \\bp]_n = [\\ap]_n[\\bp]_n\\)? The fact that the answer is in the affirmative follows from statement (g) in the introductory section to this chapter.\n\nLemma 8.2 \\((\\zn, +)\\) is an abelian group.\n\n\nProof. \n\nThis is clear from the definition of \\(+\\) on \\(\\zn\\).\n\n\nSuppose that we now change the binary operation on \\(\\zn\\) from addition modulo \\(n\\) to multiplication modulo \\(n\\). Let us take \\(\\Z_5\\) as an example and construct the operation table (in all of the following examples we shall, for convenience, write \\(a\\) in place of \\([a]_n\\)).\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n\\otimes_5&0&1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&1&2&3&4\\\\\n1&0&1&2&3&4\\\\\n2&0&2&4&1&3\\\\\n3&0&3&1&4&2\\\\\n4&0&4&3&2&1\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nAs we can see, \\((\\Z_5, \\times)\\) cannot be a group as the element 0 has no inverse; recall that under multiplication the identity element is 1 and in the table above it is clear that there does not exist an element of \\(\\Z_5\\), \\(a\\) say, such that \\(0 \\times a = a \\times 0 = 1\\). So what if we remove 0 from the set and consider \\((\\Z_5 \\backslash \\{0\\}, \\times)\\)? It should be clear, from an examination of the table above, that this results in the following group (check the axioms):\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\otimes_5&1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&2&3&4\\\\\n2&2&4&1&3\\\\\n3&3&1&4&2\\\\\n4&4&3&2&1\n\\end{array}\\]\nThe obvious question to ask at this point is whether or not this process works for all \\(n \\in \\N\\). Consider \\((\\Z_8 \\backslash \\{0\\}, \\times)\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}\n\\otimes_8&1&2&3&4&5&6&7\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&2&3&4&5&6&7 \\\\\n2&2&4&6&0&2&4&6 \\\\\n3&3&6&1&4&7&2&5 \\\\\n4&4&0&4&0&4&0&4 \\\\\n5&5&2&7&4&1&6&3 \\\\\n6&6&4&2&0&6&4&2 \\\\\n7&7&6&5&4&3&2&1\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nClearly this does not form a group for two reasons. First, the set is not closed under \\(\\otimes_8\\) and, second, not all elements have an inverse in the set (1, 3, 5, and 7 have inverses in the set, but 2, 4, and 6 do not). Notice, also, that it is the non-invertible elements that cause the system to be not closed. So, what if we were to remove the elements that have no inverse in the set? \\[\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\otimes_8&1&3&5&7\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&3&5&7\\\\\n3&3&1&7&5\\\\\n5&5&7&1&3\\\\\n7&7&5&3&1\n\\end{array}\\] This system now forms a group. But what is the relationship between the elements of \\(\\zn\\) that have no inverse and \\(n\\) itself? On the face of the above example, it looks like we simply remove the even numbers from the set. However, if we consider \\((\\Z_{12}\\backslash \\{0\\}, \\times)\\), in order for that to be a group we need to remove the elements 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10. So how do we identify the invertible elements in \\(\\zn\\)? The answer comes from the following definition:\n\nDefinition 8.6 (Reduced Residue System) The reduced residue system modulo \\(n\\) is denoted and defined by \\[\\znx = \\{ \\, [a]_n \\in \\zn \\where \\exists \\, [b]_n \\in \\zn \\, \\text{s.t.} \\, [a]_n[b]_n = [1]_n \\, \\}.\\]\n\n\nTheorem 8.4 For any positive integer \\(n\\), \\(\\znx\\) is an abelian group.\n\n\nProof. \n\nIf \\(\\znx\\) is a group then it must be an abelian group since the product is commutative. We therefore verify that \\(\\znx\\) forms a group under multiplication.\n\nClosure:\n\nLet \\([a]_{n},[b]_{n} \\in \\znx\\). Then there are elements \\([a']_{n},[b']_{n} \\in \\zn\\) such that \\([a]_{n}[a']_{n} = [1]_[n] = [b]_{n}[b']_{n}\\). Now consider \\([ab]_{n}\\). Observe \\[[ab]_{n}[a'b']_{n} = [(ab)(a'b')]_{n} = [1]_{n}\\] since \\(ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\) and \\(a'b' \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\).\n\nAssoociativity:\n\nLet \\([a]_n,[b]_n,[c]_{n} \\in \\znx\\). Then, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n([a]_n[b]_{n})[c]_{n} &=& [ab]_{n}[c]_n \\\\\n&=& [(ab)c]_{n} \\\\\n&=& [a(bc)]_{n}\\\\\n&=&[a]_{n}[bc]_{n}\\\\\n&=& [a]_{n}([b]_{n}[c]_n).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\nIdentity:\n\nIt is clear that \\([1]_n \\in \\znx\\) is the identity element.\n\nInverses:\n\nLet \\([a]_n \\in \\znx\\). By definition, there is an element \\([a']_{n} \\in \\zn\\) such that \\([a]_{n}[a']_{n} = [1]_n\\). Notice that \\([a']_{n}[a]_{n} = [1]_{n}\\) also. It follows that \\([a']_{n} \\in \\znx\\) and every element \\([a]_{n} \\in \\znx\\) has an inverse in \\(\\znx\\).\n\n\n\n\nOne consequence of the definition is that we can characterise \\(\\znx\\) in a different way, namely as the set of all positive integers less than \\(n\\) that are relatively prime to \\(n\\) (from here on in we shall, in general, use a single representative of a residue class to represent the class itself). Note, however, that this is not an alternative definition, just a convenient way of ‘seeing’ \\(\\znx\\). One advantage of this characterisation is that it makes it easy to identify the elements in the set and, hence, to determine the size of the set (more of that later).\n\nExample 8.11 The elements of \\(\\Z_{15}^{\\times}\\) are the positive integers that are relatively prime to 15. \\[\\Z_{15}^{\\times} = \\{1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14\\}\\] and the operation table is \\[\\begin{array}{c|cccccccc}\n\\otimes_{15}&1&2&4&7&8&11&13&14\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&2&4&7&8&11&13&14\\\\\n2&2&4&8&14&1&7&11&13\\\\\n4&4&8&1&13&2&14&7&11\\\\\n7&7&14&13&4&11&2&1&8\\\\\n8&8&1&2&11&4&13&14&7\\\\\n11&11&7&14&2&13&1&8&4\\\\\n13&13&11&7&1&14&8&4&2\\\\\n14&14&13&11&8&7&4&2&1\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nWhat we have discussed above leads to the following corollary.\n\nCorollary 8.4 \\((\\zn \\backslash \\{[0]_n\\}, \\times)\\) is a group if and only if \\(n\\) is prime.\n\n\nProof. \n\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\): Suppose \\((\\zn \\backslash \\{[0]_n\\}, \\times)\\) is a group. Suppose \\(n = pq\\) for some positive integers \\(p,q \\le n\\). If \\(p,q &lt; n\\), then \\([p]_n,[q]_{n} \\in \\zn \\backslash \\{[0]_{n}\\}\\) and \\[[p]_{n}[q]_{n} =[pq]_{n}= [n]_{n} = [0]_{n}.\\] This is a contradiction since, by assumption, \\((\\zn \\backslash \\{[0]_n\\}, \\times)\\) is a group and so it is closed under time. It follows that one of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is equal to \\(n\\) and the other is equal to \\(1\\). Thus the only divisors of \\(n\\) and \\(1\\) and itself — \\(n\\) is prime.\n\\(\\Leftarrow\\): If \\(n\\) is prime then \\(\\znx = \\zn \\backslash \\{[0]_{n}\\}\\) (by the alternative characterisation above). Therefore, \\((\\zn \\backslash \\{[0]_n\\}, \\times)\\) is a group since it is precisely \\((\\znx, \\times)\\).\n\n\n\nExample 8.12  \n\nWrite down the elements of \\(\\Z^{\\times}_{20}\\) and \\(\\Z^{\\times}_{24}\\).\n\nWe have \\[\\Z^{\\times}_{20} = \\{1,3,7,9,11,13,17,19\\}\\] and \\[\\Z_{24}^{\\times} = \\{1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23\\}.\\]\n\nClassify, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, all of the abelian groups of order 8.\n\nWe decompose \\(8 = 2^3\\). This gives isomorphically distinct abelian groups \\[\\Z_{4}, \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2, \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2.\\]\n\nThe groups in (a) are isomorphic to which of the groups in (b)?\n\nThe group \\(Z^{\\times}_{20}\\) has elements of order \\(4\\) and none of order \\(8\\) and so must be isomorphic to \\(\\Z_{4}\\times \\Z_{2}\\); for \\(Z^{\\times}_{24}\\) all of its elements have order \\(2\\) and so it is also isomorphic to \\(\\Z_{2}\\times \\Z_{2}\\times \\Z_{2}\\).\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.13  \n\nList the elements of \\(\\Z^{\\times}_9\\).\n\n\\[\\Z_9^{\\times} = \\{1,2,4,5,7,8,\\}.\\]\n\nShow that this group is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_6\\).\n\nWe need only show that \\(\\Z_9^{\\times}\\) is cyclic. Indeed it is generated by \\(2\\), and also by \\(5\\).\n\nFind two distinct isomorphisms between \\(\\Z^{\\times}_9\\) and \\(\\Z_6\\).\n\nThe two distinct isomorphisms arise from the two different generators:\n\n\\(\\theta_1: \\Z_9^{\\times} \\to \\Z_6\\) by \\(\\theta_1(2^{i}) = i\\) for \\(0 \\le i \\le 5\\);\n\\(\\theta_2: \\Z_9^{\\times} \\to \\Z_6\\) by \\(\\theta_2(5^{i}) = i\\) for \\(0 \\le i \\le 5\\).\n\nWe note that \\(\\theta_1 \\ne \\theta_2\\) since \\(\\theta_1(5) = 5\\) and \\(\\theta_2(5) = 1\\).",

    "text": "8.3 Applications to Number Theory\nIn the last part of this chapter we shall examine how we can use our knowledge of groups to solve problems in number theory and, in particular, we shall be studying three theorems, namely Fermat’s Little Theorem (FLT), Euler’s Theorem, and Wilson’s Theorem. It is hoped that this very short review of number theoretic problems will not only convince you of the power of the abstract algebra that we have studied to date, but also whet your appetite for the third-year Number Theory and Cryptography module.\nWe begin with a statement of Fermat’s Little Theorem.\n\nTheorem 8.5 (Fermat’s Little Theorem) Let \\(p\\) be a prime and let \\(a\\) be any integer such that \\(p\\) does not divide \\(a\\). Then \\[a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\modu p).\\]\n\n\nProof. \n\nFirst we note that if \\(p\\) does not divide \\(a\\), then \\([a]_{p} \\in \\Z_{p}^{\\times}\\) (\\(a\\) is co-prime to \\(p\\)).\nThe result is now a consequence of Theorem 4.1. We can see this as follows: \\(|\\Z_{p}^{\\times}| = p-1\\) since \\(\\Z_{p}^{\\times}= \\Z_{p}\\backslash\\{[0]_{p}\\}\\). Now Theorem 4.1 states that the order of \\([a]_{p}\\) divides \\(|\\Z_{p}^{\\times}|\\). It follows that \\(([a]_{p})^{p-1} = [a^{p-1}]_{p} = [1]_{p}\\). Thus \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\).\n\n\n\nExample 8.14 What is the principal remainder on dividing \\(6^{82}\\) by 17?\n\nSolution:\nObserve that \\(17\\) is prime and so we can make use of Fermat’s Little Theorem to simplify this calculation. Write \\(82 = (5 \\times 16) + 2\\). Then \\(6^{82} = (6^{16})^{5} \\times 6^2\\). By FLT, \\(6^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}\\). Therefore, \\[(6^{16})^{5} \\times 6^2 \\equiv 6^2 \\pmod{17} \\equiv 2 \\pmod 17.\\]\n\n\n\nExample 8.15 Show that, for every positive integer \\(n\\), the number \\(n^{33}-n\\) is divisible by 15.\n\nFirst observe that \\(n^{33}-n = n(n^{32}-1)\\). Next observe that \\(15| n^33 - n\\) if and only if both \\(5\\) and \\(3\\) divide \\(n^{33} -n\\). Since 5 and 3 are prime we can make use of FLT. We show that both \\(5\\) and \\(3\\) divide \\(n(n^{32}-1)\\).\n\n\\(3|(n^{33}-n)\\): If \\(3\\) divides \\(n\\) we are done. If \\(3\\) does not divide \\(n\\), then \\(n\\) and \\(3\\) are relatively prime. Write \\(32 = 2\\times 16\\). Then \\[n^{32} \\equiv (n^2)^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\] by FLT. Therefore \\(n^{32} -1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\) and \\(3|(n^32 -1)\\).\n\\(5|(n^{33}-n)\\): If \\(5\\) divides \\(n\\) we are done. If \\(5\\) does not divide \\(n\\), then \\(n\\) and \\(5\\) are relatively prime. Write \\(32 = 4\\times 8\\). Then \\[n^{32} \\equiv (n^4)^{8} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\\] by FLT. Therefore \\(n^{32} -1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}\\) and \\(5|(n^32 -1)\\).\n\n\n\nThe obvious question to ask is whether we can generalise the above result to include composite moduli. Consider the conditions that apply for FLT to work; first, we work modulo a prime, second we have that \\(p\\) does not divide \\(a\\). Recall that if \\(p\\) is prime the statement \\(p\\) does not divide \\(a\\) is equivalent to saying that \\(p\\) and \\(a\\) are relatively prime. So, a naive approach to extending the theorem to composite numbers would be to conjecture as follows:\n\nLet \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) be integers such that \\(\\greatcd (a, n)=1\\). Then \\(a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\modu n)\\).\n\nDoes this work?\n\nThis does not work. A counterexample is as follows: take \\(n = 4\\) and \\(a=3\\). Then \\(\\gcd(a,n) = \\gcd(3,4) =1\\). However \\[3^{3} \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}.\\]\n\nSo, is there a way in which we can generalise FLT to cover non-prime moduli? The answer is ‘yes’ and the solution lies in considering the exponent of \\(a\\); if we are raising \\(a\\) to the power of \\(p-1\\), where \\(p\\) is prime, that is the same as raising it to the power of the order of \\(\\Z_p^{\\times}\\) since this group has \\(p-1\\) elements (a fact that was used in our proof of FLT). We consider, then, raising \\(a\\) to the power of the order of \\(\\znx\\) where \\(n \\in \\N\\) and working modulo \\(n\\).\n\nDefinition 8.7 (Euler Totient Function) Let \\(m, n \\in \\N\\). The Euler totient function, denoted \\(\\phi\\), is the function \\(\\phi : \\N \\rightarrow \\N\\) defined by \\[\\phi (n) = | \\, \\{m \\in \\N \\where m \\leq n \\, \\text{and} \\, \\greatcd (m, n)=1 \\} \\, |, \\;\\; \\forall \\, n \\in \\N.\\]\n\nNote that this is, in fact, \\(| \\znx |\\).\n\nExample 8.16  \n\n\\(\\phi(30) = |\\{1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29\\}| = 8\\).\n\n\nWe can now generalise FLT to include composite moduli as follows:\n\nTheorem 8.6 (Euler’s Theorem) Let \\(n \\in \\N\\) and \\(a \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime. Then, \\[a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\modu n).\\]\n\n\nProof. \n\nThe proof is almost identical to the proof of FLT. The key ingredient is once more Lagrange’s Theorem.\nLet \\(a \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(\\gcd(a,n) =1\\). Then \\([a]_{n} \\ne [0]_{n}\\) and \\([a]_{n} \\in \\znx\\). Now as \\(|\\znx| = \\phi(n)|\\), we have, by Lagrange’s Theorem that \\[([a]_{n})^{\\phi(n)} = [1]_{n}.\\] Therefore \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\) as required.\n\n\nHopefully, the success or failure of our chosen attempts to generalise FLT will now make complete sense.\n\nLet us revisit the \\(n=4\\) and \\(a =3\\) example. Notice that \\(\\phi(4) = 2\\) and \\(3^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\).\n\nThis function, together with Euler’s Theorem, prove to be extremely useful tools in solving number-theoretic problems.\n\nExample 8.17 Find the unit digit of \\(3^{101}\\).\n\nNotice that if \\(d \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots, 9\\}\\) is the unit digit of \\(3^{101}\\), then \\(3^{101} \\equiv d \\pmod{10}\\) since there is a \\(q \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(3^{101} = 10q + d\\). We use Euler’s Theorem to compute \\(d\\). Note that \\(\\phi(10) =|\\{1,3,7,9\\}| =  4\\) and \\(101 = 4 \\times 25 + 1\\). It follows that \\[3^{101} = (3^{4})^{25} \\times 3) \\equiv 1 \\times 3 \\pmod{10}.\\] The last digit of \\(3^{101}\\) is therefore \\(3\\).\n\n\nThe function \\(\\phi : \\N \\rightarrow \\N\\) has some remarkable properties. But, given \\(n \\in \\N\\), how do we calculate \\(\\phi (n)\\)? If \\(n\\) is large it will be very time consuming to investigate all of the natural numbers less than \\(n\\) to establish which are relatively prime to \\(n\\). We might hope for a formula to allow us to calculate \\(\\phi (n)\\) for any \\(n \\in \\N\\), but where do we start in trying to find such a formula? The following table lists \\(\\phi (n)\\) for \\(1 \\leq n \\leq 30\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n\n\\(\\phi(n)\\)\n1\n1\n2\n2\n4\n2\n6\n4\n6\n4\n10\n4\n12\n6\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n\n\n\\(\\phi(n)\\)\n8\n16\n6\n18\n8\n12\n10\n22\n8\n20\n12\n18\n12\n28\n8\n\n\n\nThere does not appear to be a pattern, except that \\(\\phi (n)\\) appears to always be even for \\(n&gt;2\\)… to find out more you need to sign up for third-year Number Theory and Cryptography!\nNotice the very close link between FLT and Euler’s Theorem.\n\nFLT is a corollary of Euler’s Theorem: if \\(p\\) is prime, \\(\\phi(p) = p-1\\) and so for \\(a \\in \\Z\\) relatively prime to \\(p\\), \\(a^{\\phi(p)} = a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\).\n\nIt is worth noting that Euler’s totient function and Euler’s Theorem are central to a cryptosystem called RSA, an algorithm for public-key cryptography, developed in 1977, that relies on the prime factorisation of extremely large integers and which is used for, inter alia, encrypting credit card data during purchases over the internet. Again, more of that in third-year Number Theory and Cryptography.\nWe conclude our very brief survey of applications of group theory to number theory with an investigation. Returning to that Friday evening from Chapter 6, having become bored with rearranging your ten Maths text books, and having already deduced that there are 10! possible arrangements of those books on your shelf, your mind turns to modular arithmetic (you really need to get out more…). You decide to investigate the relationship between the number of arrangements of \\(n \\in \\N\\) books and that number modulo \\(n\\). You realise that this is trivial since \\(n! \\equiv 0 \\modu n)\\) for all natural numbers \\(n\\) so, determined to find something more interesting (and still waiting for someone to invite you out), you decide to investigate the relationship between \\((n-1)!\\) and itself modulo \\(n\\). Some rapid calculations yield the following table:\n\n\n\n\\(n\\)\n\\((n-1)!\\)\n\\((n-1)!\\pmod{n}\\)\n\n\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n3\n2\n2\n\n\n4\n6\n2\n\n\n5\n24\n4\n\n\n6\n120\n0\n\n\n7\n720\n6\n\n\n8\n5040\n0\n\n\n9\n40320\n0\n\n\n10\n362880\n0\n\n\n11\n3628800\n10\n\n\n12\n39916800\n0\n\n\n\nYou think that you are spotting a pattern, but now, so engrossed in it all, you carry on to test your hypothesis further…\n\n\n\n\\(n\\)\n\\((n-1)!\\)\n\\((n-1)!\\pmod{n}\\)\n\n\n13\nbig\n12\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n17\nvery big\n16\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n19\nhumongous\n18\n\n\n\nSatisfied, you postulate that there is a relationship between \\((n-1)!\\) and itself modulo \\(n\\) if \\(n\\) is prime. You have discovered Wilson’s Theorem.\n\nTheorem 8.7 (Wilson’s Theorem) If \\(p\\) is prime, then \\((p-1)! \\equiv -1 \\modu p)\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nWe begin with the following observation. Let \\(1 \\le x \\le p-1\\) and suppose that \\(x\\) is its own inverse in \\(\\Z_{p}^{\\times}\\). This means that \\(x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\). Rearranging, \\(x^2 -1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\\). Therefore \\(p|(x^2-1)\\). Using the difference of two squares \\(p|((x-1)(x+1)\\). Since \\(p\\) is prime either \\(p|(x-1)\\) or \\(p|(x+1)\\). Thus \\(x \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{p}\\). Since \\(1 \\le x \\le p-1\\), then \\(x = 1\\) or \\(x =p-1\\). Thus \\(x \\in \\Z_{p}^{\\times}\\backslash\\{1,p-1\\}\\), the inverse of \\(x \\in \\Z_{p}^{\\times}\\) is not equal to \\(x\\). For \\(2 \\le x &lt; p-1\\) write \\(x^{-1}\\) for the element of \\(y \\in \\{2,3,\\ldots, p-2\\}\\) such that \\(xy \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\). Thus we can find elements \\(x_1, x_2 ,\\ldots, x_{\\left(\\frac{p-3}{2}\\right)} \\in  \\{2,3,\\ldots, p-2\\}\\) such that\n\\[(p-1)!  = 1\\times (x_1 \\times x_1^{-1})\\times (x_2\\times x_2^{-1}) \\ldots \\left(x_{\\left(\\frac{p-3}{2}\\right)} x_{\\left(\\frac{p-3}{2}\\right)}^{-1}\\right) \\times (p-1).\\]\nWorking modulo \\(p\\), we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n(p-1)!  &=& 1\\times (2 \\times 2^{-1})\\times (3\\times 3^{-1}) \\ldots \\left(\\left(\\frac{p-1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{p-1}{2}\\right)^{-1}\\right) \\times (p-1) \\\\\n&\\equiv& 1\\times 1 \\times 1 \\ldots 1 \\times (p-1) \\pmod{p} \\\\\n&\\equiv& (p-1) \\pmod{p} \\\\\n&\\equiv& -1 \\pmod{p}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nas required.\n\n\n\nExample 8.18 Arrange the integers \\(2, 3, \\ldots , 11\\) into pairs \\((a\\times b)\\) satisfying \\(ab \\equiv 1 \\modu 13)\\).\n\nSolution: We have \\[(2\\times 7)(3 \\times 9)(4 \\times 10)(5 \\times 8)(6 \\times 11).\\]\n\n\n\nExample 8.19 Find the principal remainder when 15! is divided by 17.\n\nWe use Wilson’s Theorem: \\(16! = 16 \\times 15! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}\\). It follows that \\(15! \\equiv (-1) (16)^{-1}\\pmod{17}\\). Since \\(16\\) is its own inverse in \\(\\Z_{17}^{\\times}\\). It follows that \\(15! \\equiv -16 \\pmod{17}\\); \\(15! \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}\\). The principal remainder when \\(15!\\) is divided by 17 is therefore 1.\n\n\n\nExample 8.20 Find the inverses of 10, 9 and 8 in \\(\\Z_{11}^{\\times}\\) and hence find the remainder when 7! is divided by 11.\n\nWe note that \\(10 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}\\) and so \\(10\\) is its own inverse i \\(\\Z_{11}\\).\nNow \\(9 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{11}\\). Therefore \\[9 \\times 5 \\equiv -10\\pmod{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\\] and so \\(9^{-1} = 5\\)\nLastly \\(8 \\equiv -3 \\pmod{11}\\) and so \\[8 \\times -4 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}.\\] It follows that \\(8^{-1} = 7\\).\nWe apply Wilson’s Theorem to compute the remainder of \\(7!\\) when divided by \\(11\\). We have: \\[10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}.\\] Therefore \\[7! \\equiv -(10^{-1}\\times 9^{-1}\\times 8^{-1})\\pmod{11}.\\] Hence \\[7! \\equiv 35 \\pmod{11}\\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}.\\]\n\n\n\nExample 8.21 Use Wilson’s Theorem to find the principal remainder on dividing 51! by 61.\n\nApplying Wilson’s Theorem: \\[51! \\equiv -(60 \\cdot 59 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 52)^{-1}\\pmod{61}.\\] Now we use the fact that \\[60 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{61}, 59 \\equiv -2\\pmod{61}, \\ldots, 52 \\equiv -9\\pmod{61}.\\] Therefore \\[60 \\cdot 59 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 52 \\equiv  -(9!) \\pmod{61}.\\]\nNow \\(9! = 7! \\times 72\\). We decompose \\(7! = 7 \\times 60 \\times 12\\). Thus \\[7! \\equiv - 84 \\pmod{61} \\equiv 38 \\pmod {61}.\\] On the other hand \\(72 \\equiv 11 \\pmod {61}\\). Therefore \\(9! \\equiv 38 \\times 11 \\pmod{61} \\equiv 52 \\pmod{61}\\).\nNow we compute \\(52^{-1} \\in \\Z_{61}^{\\times}\\). We use the fact that \\(52 \\equiv -9 = -3 \\times 3 \\pmod{61}\\). Now \\(3^{-1} \\in \\Z_{61}^{\\times}\\) is \\(-20\\). Therefore \\[(-9)^{-1} = (-3)^{-1}\\times 3^{-1} \\equiv 20 \\times -20 = 27 \\pmod{61}.\\]\nIt follows that \\(51! \\equiv 9! \\equiv 27 \\pmod{61}\\).\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the converse of Wilson’s Theorem is also true (it is, in fact, an if and only if statement), that is if \\((p-1)! \\equiv -1 \\modu p)\\) then \\(p\\) is prime. This is, however, not much use as a primality test!",

We also know that \\(\\Z_4\\) is cyclic , whereas \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\) is not. So, in order to show that \\(\\Z^{\\times}_{12}\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\), we simply need to demonstrate that it is not cyclic. The easiest way to do this is to show that \\(\\Z^{\\times}_{12}\\) does not contain any element of period 4 (if the group is cyclic it must have a generator which must have a period equal to the order of the group). Note that\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n5^2 &=& 25 \\equiv 1 \\modu 12)\\\\\n7^2 &=& 49 \\equiv 1 \\modu 12)\\\\\n11^2 &=& 121 \\equiv 1 \\modu 12).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nHence every element has period 2, except for the identity which has period 1. So \\(\\Z^{\\times}_{12}\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\) and not \\(\\Z_4\\).\nAs every element of each of those two groups (identity excepted) has period 2, an isomorphism is not difficult to find.

Recall what the theorem says:\n\nIf \\(p\\) is prime, \\(a \\in \\Z\\) and \\(p\\) does not divide \\(a\\), then \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\modu p)\\).\n\nLet \\(p = 11\\) and \\(a = 2\\). Now 11 does not divide 2, so we can use FLT and \\[2^{11-1} = 2^{10} \\equiv 1 \\modu 11).\\] Now \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n2^{11,213} - 1 &=& 2^3 (2^{11,210}) - 1\\\\\n&=& 8 (2^{10})^{1121} - 1\\\\\n&\\equiv&8 (1)^{1121} - 1 \\; \\modu 11)\\\\\n&\\equiv&8 - 1 \\; \\modu 11)\\\\\n&\\equiv& 7 \\modu 11).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nSo, \\(2^{11,213} - 1\\) leaves principal remainder 7 on division by 11.\nNote that 11,213 is prime and it can be shown that \\(2^{11,213} - 1\\) is prime. Primes of the form \\(2^p - 1\\) are called Mersenne primes. The largest known prime is a Mersenne prime; discovered in 2017 it is \\(2^{77,232,917} - 1\\) and has 23,249,425 digits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8.6\n\n\nFind the inverses of 16, 17 and 18 in \\(\\Z^{\\times}_{19}\\).

We know from the proof of Wilson’s Theorem that in \\(\\Z^{\\times}_p\\), where \\(p\\) is prime, the self-inverse elements are 1 and \\(p-1\\). So, the inverse of 18 in \\(\\Z^{\\times}_{19}\\) is 18 (which, of course, is equivalent to \\(-1 \\modu 19)\\)).\nNow, \\(17^{-1} = 9\\) since \\(17 \\times 9 = 153\\) and \\(153 \\equiv 1 \\modu 19)\\).\nSimilarly, \\(16^{-1} = 6\\).\nRecall that Wilson’s Theorem states that if \\(p\\) is prime then \\((p-1)! \\equiv -1 \\modu p)\\). So, with \\(p=19\\) we have \\(18! \\equiv -1 \\modu 19)\\).\\\\ Now, using the above results, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n15! &=& 18! \\times 18^{-1} \\times 17^{-1} \\times 16^{-1}\\\\\n&\\equiv& (-1) \\times (-1) \\times 9 \\times 6 \\modu 19)\\\\\n&\\equiv& 54 \\modu 19)\\\\\n&\\equiv& 16 \\modu 19)\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] Hence, the principal remainder is 16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8.7\n\n\nLet \\(p\\) be a prime except 2 and 5. Deduce from Fermat’s Little Theorem that there is a multiple of \\(p\\), all of whose digits in decimal notation are 9’s.\n[Example: \\(142857\\times 7=999999\\).]\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 8.7\n\n\n\n\nSolution 8.7\n\n\nNote that \\(999 \\ldots 9 = 10^k - 1\\) for some \\(k \\in \\Z\\). So, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nnp = 999 \\ldots 9 &\\Leftrightarrow& 10^k - 1 = np\\\\\n&\\Leftrightarrow& 10^k \\equiv 1 \\,\\modu p)\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] Now, \\(p \\neq 2\\) and \\(p \\neq 5\\), hence \\(10\\) is not a multiple of \\(p\\), that is \\(p \\, \\nmid \\,10\\). Hence, by FLT, \\(10^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\,\\modu p)\\) with \\(p \\neq 2, \\, 5\\). Then, with \\(p=7\\), say, \\(10^6 \\equiv 1 \\, \\modu 7)\\) and so \\(999,999 = 7n\\) for some \\(n\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8.8\n\n\nConsider the set of Hilbert Numbers, \\(\\Sbb = \\{ n \\in \\N \\, | \\, n \\equiv 1 \\modu 4) \\}\\). This is the set of all integers that are of the form \\(4k + 1\\), where \\(k \\in \\N\\). Find the first five ‘primes’ in this set (called Hilbert Primes). What is the smallest number in \\(\\Sbb\\) that does not have a unique factorisation in Hilbert Primes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 8.8\n\n\n\n\nSolution 8.8\n\n\nFirst, it helps to visualise what numbers are actually in the set. Since we are going to be looking at primes in the set we need only consider members of \\(\\Sbb\\) that are positive. So \\[\\Sbb = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, \\ldots \\}.\\]\nWe then need a suitable definition of ‘prime’ within the context of this set. If we use our usual definition for primes in \\(\\N\\), we need to be careful that we refer to divisibility within the set. So, we define a Hilbert prime as a member of \\(\\Sbb\\) greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 (which is in \\(\\Sbb\\)) and itself. Then, the first five Hilbert primes are 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21. Note that 9 and 21 are both divisible by 3 in \\(\\Z\\), but 3 is not in \\(\\Sbb\\).\nLike the case of \\(\\E\\) in the lectures, the unique factorisation principle in \\(\\N\\) breaks down in \\(\\Sbb\\). The first number in \\(\\Sbb\\) to exhibit multiple prime factorisations is \\[441 = 9 \\times 49 = 21 \\times 21.\\]",

    "text": "9.1 Rings\nIn certain respects rings will probably seem more intuitive than groups since you have been using rings, and closely related structures, in your mathematical studies since primary school. On the other hand, though, the study of rings and fields is more complicated than the study of groups by virtue of the fact that we are now dealing with sets on which we are defining two binary operations, which we generally label addition and multiplication. Although we shall only be taking a cursory glance at these structures we shall be adopting an axiomatic approach, so we begin with a definition.\nStrictly speaking we should denote a ring as \\((R, +, \\times)\\) but, similarly to groups, we shall often simply refer to a ring as \\(R\\).\nNote that the above definition can be summed up as: \\((R, +, \\times)\\) is a ring if and only if \\((R, +)\\) is an abelian group which, along with the binary operation \\(\\times\\), satisfies R6-R8.\nNote, also, that whilst the axioms demand that the additive operation is commutative for any ring, there is no such requirement for the multiplicative operation. In the case where the ring \\(R\\) has \\(ab=ba \\; \\forall \\, a, b \\in R\\) we say that \\(R\\) is a commutative ring.\nThe following should be very familiar to everyone.",

A similar argument demonstrates that \\(a0_{R} = 0_{R}\\).\nIt suffices to show that \\(ab+ a(-b) = ab + (-a)b = 0_{R}\\) since \\((\\R,+)\\) is an abelian group and inverses are unique. We have: \\[ ab + a(-b) = a(b + (-b))= a0_R = 0_R\\] where the last equality follows from i.. One can similarly show that \\(ab + (-a)b = 0_{R}\\).\nWe have by ii. that \\(-(a(-b))= (-a)(-b)\\). Again by ii., \\(a(-b) = -(ab)\\). Therefore, \\[(-a)(-b) = -(a(-b)) = -(-(ab)) = ab\\] using the fact that \\(-(-(ab)) = ab\\) since \\((\\R,+)\\) is a group.\n\n\n\n\n9.1.1 Identity Elements\nAn identity element in a ring, \\(R\\), is a multiplicative identity. Hence, an identity element \\(1_R \\in R\\) is such that \\(a1_R = 1_Ra = a\\) for all \\(a \\in R\\). We assume that all of the rings that we encounter in this chapter have multiplicative identities. A ring with an identity element is sometimes referred to as a ring with a one.\n\n\n9.1.2 Subrings\nThe concept of a subring is the same, in principle, as the concept of a subgroup. A subset of a ring \\(R\\) forms a subring of \\(R\\) if and only if it is a ring in its own right. As with groups, we have tests for whether or not a subset of \\(R\\) forms a subring and that is the subject of the following theorem.\n\nLet \\(R\\) be a ring and let \\(S \\subseteq R\\). Then \\(S\\) is a subring of \\(R\\) if and only if the three conditions below are satisfied:\n\n\\(S\\) has an identity element;\n\\(a, b \\in S \\, \\imp \\, a-b \\in S\\);\n\\(a, b \\in S \\, \\imp \\, ab \\in S\\)\n\n\n\nProof. Let \\(R\\) be a ring and let \\(S\\) be a subset of \\(R\\).\n\\((\\imp)\\) First we show that if \\(S\\) is a subring of \\(R\\) then the three conditions hold.\n\nAs \\(S\\) is a subring then \\(1_S \\in S\\) by definition (all our rings have a one).\nNow let \\(a, b \\in S\\). Since \\(S\\) is a ring it must be closed under addition. Further there is an additive inverse for \\(b\\) in \\(S\\) (R4) and since additive inverses are unique in \\(R\\) this inverse is the same as \\(-b\\) in \\(R\\). Hence \\(a-b = a+(-b) \\in S\\).\nSimilarly, \\(S\\) is closed under multiplication.\n\n\\((\\limp)\\) Next we show that if \\(S\\) satisfies the three enumerated conditions then it is a subring of \\(R\\), that is, \\(S\\) is a ring in itself with the operations on \\(S\\) being defined as the operations on \\(R\\).\nBy i. \\(S\\) is non-empty.\nSince \\(S\\) is non-empty, let \\(a \\in S\\). By ii., \\(a-a \\in S\\) and so \\(0_R \\in S\\). We claim that \\(0_R\\) is an additive identity for \\(S\\). For any \\(s \\in S\\), we have \\(0_R+s=s\\), since \\(s \\in R\\) and since \\(0_R\\) is the additive identity in \\(R\\). Thus \\(0_R\\) is an additive identity for \\(S\\).\nLet \\(a \\in S\\). Then, by ii. we have \\(0_S-a \\in S\\). But \\(0_S-a=0_S+(-a)\\), where \\(-a\\) is the additive inverse of \\(a\\) in \\(R\\). So \\(-a \\in S\\) and \\(-a\\) is an additive inverse for \\(a\\) in \\(S\\).\nLet \\(a, b \\in S\\). Then \\(-b \\in S\\) and \\(-(-b)=b\\), since if \\(-b\\) is an additive inverse for \\(b\\), then \\(b\\) is an additive inverse for \\(-b\\). Thus, \\(a+b=a-(-b) \\in S\\), by ii., so \\(S\\) is closed under addition.\nLet \\(a, b \\in S\\). Then \\(a+b \\in S\\) as \\(S\\) is closed under addition and, since \\(a, b \\in R\\), we have \\(a+b=b+a\\) by commutativity of addition in \\(R\\).\nLet \\(a, b, c \\in S\\). Then, since \\(a, b, c \\in R\\), we have that \\(a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c\\) and closure ensures that these sums are in \\(S\\).\nLet \\(a, b, c \\in S\\). Since \\(a, b, c \\in R\\) then \\(a(bc)=(ab)c\\) in \\(R\\) and since \\(S\\) is closed under multiplication then \\(a(bc)=(ab)c\\) in \\(S\\).\nBy assumption \\(S\\) has a multiplicative identity \\(1_{S}\\).\n\nNote that this theorem ensures that in any ring \\(R\\), both \\(\\{0_R\\}\\) and \\(R\\) itself are subrings of \\(R\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nLet \\(R\\) be a ring and \\(S\\) be a subring of \\(R\\). Then it is not necessarily the case that \\(1_{S} = 1_{R}\\). For example Let \\(R = \\Z\\). Then \\(S = \\{0\\}\\) is a subring of \\(R\\) however \\(1_S = 0 \\ne 1 = 1_{R}\\).\n\n\n\nLet \\(R\\) be a ring. The centre of \\(R\\) is denoted and defined by \\[Z(R) = \\{ a \\in R \\where ab=ba \\, \\forall \\, b \\in R \\}.\\] Prove that \\(Z(R)\\) is a subring of \\(R\\).\n\nSolution:\nFirst observe that \\(Z(R)\\) is non-empty since it contains \\(1_{R}\\). Note that \\(1_R\\) is therefore also the identity element of \\(Z(R)\\).\nLet \\(a,b \\in Z(R)\\) and \\(r \\in R\\). Then, \\[(a-b)r = ar - br = ra -rb = r(a-b)\\] and \\[(abr) = a(br) = (ar)b = r(ab).\\] Therefore \\((a-b),ab \\in Z(R)\\) as well. We conclude that \\(Z(R)\\) is a subring of \\(R\\).\n\n\nIt is important to be careful when considering the identity element in a subring given that there are two binary operations to take into account. Recall that the identity element in a ring is the multiplicative identity; the definition of a ring takes care of the additive identity \\(0_R\\). We know that \\(S=(\\{0_R\\}, +, \\times)\\) is a subring of \\(R\\), but does it have a multiplicative identity?\nUnlike groups, the identity in a subring does not have to be the same as the identity in the ring itself.\n\n\nLet \\(R = \\Z_{6}\\). The identity element in \\(1\\) since for all \\(a \\in \\Z_{6}\\), \\(1a = a1 = 1\\).\nNow take \\(S = \\{0,2,4\\}\\). Then \\(S\\) is a subring of \\(R\\) (this is an exercise). However, the identity element is \\(4\\) since \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n4 \\times 0 &=& 0 \\\\\n4 \\times 2 & =& 2 \\\\\n4 \\times 4 &=& 4.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n9.1.3 Ring Homomorphisms\n\nDefinition 9.2 (Ring Homomorphism) Let \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) be rings and let \\(\\theta : R_1 \\rightarrow R_2\\) be a mapping. Then \\(\\theta\\) is a ring homomorphism if, for all \\(a, b \\in R_1\\) \\[\\theta (a+b) = \\theta (a) + \\theta (b)\\] and \\[\\theta (ab) = \\theta (a) \\theta (b).\\]\n\nSo, the definition is analogous to that for groups save that we have to consider both binary operations. Note that the first condition is simply the statement that \\(\\theta\\) is a homomorphism mapping from the abelian group \\((R_1, +)\\) to the abelian group \\((R_2, +)\\). The second condition requires that \\(\\theta\\) relates the multiplicative structures in the same way.\n\nLet \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) be rings and let \\(\\theta : R_1 \\rightarrow R_2\\) be a ring homomorphism. Then,\n\n\\(\\theta (0_{R_1}) = 0_{R_2},\\)\n\\(\\theta (-x) = - \\theta (x)\\) for all \\(x \\in R_1\\).\n\n\n\nProof. \n\n\nWe have \\[\\theta(0_{R_1}) = \\theta(0_{R_1} + 0_{R_1}) = \\theta(0_{R_1}) + \\theta(0_{R_1}).\\] Subtracting \\(\\theta(0_{R_1})\\) from both sides, we have: \\[\\theta_{0_{R_1}} = 0_{R_2}.\\]\nWe have \\[0_{R_2}=\\theta(0_{R_1}) = \\theta(x + (-x)) =\\theta(x) + \\theta(-x).\\] Using the fact that \\((R_2, +)\\) is a group (and so inverses are unique) we conclude that \\(\\theta(-x) = -\\theta(x)\\) as required.\n\n\n\n\nConsider the mapping \\(\\theta : \\Z \\rightarrow \\Z_n\\) where \\(\\theta\\) is defined by \\(\\theta (a)\\) is the principal remainder on dividing \\(a\\) by \\(n\\) for all \\(a \\in \\Z\\). This is a ring homomorphism.\n\nLet \\(a, b \\in  \\Z\\). Let \\(0 \\le r_1,r_2 \\le n\\) and \\(q_1, q_2 \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(a = q_1 n + r_1\\) and \\(a_2 = q_2 n + r_2\\). Notice that \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) are the principal remainders of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (respectively) upon dividing by \\(n\\).\nObserve that \\[a+b  = (q_1 + q_2)n + (r_1 + r_2)\\] and \\[ab = (q_1q_2n + q_1 r_2 + q_2 r_1)n + r_1 r_2.\\]\nWe can find \\(s,t  \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots, n-1\\}\\) and \\(u,v \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(r_1 + r_2 = u n + s\\) and \\(r_1 r_2 = vn + t\\). Notice that the principal remainders of \\(a+b\\) and \\(ab\\) upon dividing by \\(n\\) are \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) respectively. Furthermore, in \\(\\Z_n\\) we have \\(r_1 + r_2 = s\\) and \\(r_1r_2 = t\\). Therefore, \\[\\theta(a+b) = s = \\theta(a) + \\theta(b)\\] and \\[\\theta(ab) = t = \\theta(a) \\theta(b).\\]\n\n\nAs we did for group homomorphisms, we can define the kernel of a ring homomorphism:\n\nDefinition 9.3 (Kernel) Let \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) be rings and let \\(\\theta : R_1 \\rightarrow R_2\\) be a ring homomorphism. The kernel of \\(\\theta\\) is the set denoted and defined by \\[\\text{ker} \\, (\\theta) = \\{ x \\in R_1 \\where \\theta(x) = 0_{R_2} \\}.\\]\n\nNote here that it is the set of elements of \\(R_1\\) that map to the additive identity in \\(R_2\\). As with groups, an isomorphism is a bijective homomorphism. Where the ring isomorphism maps from a set to itself we refer to this as an automorphism.",

    "text": "9.3 Division Rings\nIn a ring there is no requirement for any element to have a multiplicative inverse, so if a ring does have multiplicative inverses this makes the ring special. Recall from group theory that when we considered \\(\\zn\\) under multiplication we were unable to form a group unless we ejected all of the elements not relatively prime to \\(n\\). This is tantamount to discarding all of the elements that do not have a multiplicative inverse in the set\n\nDefinition 9.6 (Unit) Let \\(R\\) be a ring. If \\(a \\in R\\) has a multiplicative inverse in \\(R\\), then \\(a\\) is said to be a unit in \\(R\\).\n\nWe can collect together such units from a given ring, place them in a set and we obtain a group under multiplication.\n\n\n\nThe units of \\(\\Z\\) are \\(\\{-1,1\\}\\) — this forms a group isomorphic to \\(\\Z_{2}\\).\nThe units of \\(\\R_{2 \\times 2}\\) is precisely the group \\(GL(2,\\R)\\).\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 9.7 (Division Ring) A division ring is a (not necessarily commutative) ring in which every non-zero element is a unit.\n\nHence, for all \\(a \\in R, \\, a \\neq 0\\), there exists \\(a^{-1} \\in R\\) such that \\(aa^{-1}=a^{-1}a=1_R\\).\n\nLet \\(R\\) be a division ring.

Let \\[A = \\begin{pmatrix} z & w \\\\ -\\overline{w} & \\overline{z} \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\Hbb\\] be a non-zero element. Note that \\(A^{-1}\\) must be precisely the inverse of \\(A \\in \\C_{2 \\times 2}\\) since \\(I_2\\) is the identity element of \\(H\\). Therefore, to show that \\(H\\) is a division ring, it suffices to show that \\(A^{-1} \\in H\\). First we determine if \\(A\\) is invertible in \\(\\C_{2\\times 2}\\). We compute \\[\\det{A} = z\\overline{z} + w \\overline{w} = |z|^2 + |w|^2.\\] Since \\(A\\) is nonzero, then one of \\(z\\) or \\(w\\) is nonzero and so \\(|z|^2 + |w|^2 \\ne 0\\). Therefore \\(A\\) has a multiplicative inverse \\(A^{-1} \\in \\C_{2\\times 2}\\) given by\n\\[A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det{A}}\\begin{pmatrix} \\overline{z} & -w \\\\ \\overline{w} & z \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\nSince \\(\\det(A) \\in \\R\\), it follows that \\(\\left(\\overline{\\frac{1}{\\det{A}}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\det{A}}\\) and so \\(A^{-1} \\in \\Hbb\\).\nEvery non-zero element of \\(\\Hbb\\) is a unit and so \\(\\Hbb\\) is a division ring.\n\n\nWhere have we seen something similar to this in our study of groups? Recall that we were able to represent complex numbers as matrices in the following way:\n\nLet \\[M = \\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b & a \\end{pmatrix}: a,b \\in \\R, a^2 + b^2 \\ne 0\\right\\}.\\] We found that \\((\\C \\backslash \\{0\\}, \\times) \\cong (M, \\times)\\) with an isomorphism \\(\\theta: M \\to \\C\\backslash\\{0\\}\\) by \\[\\theta\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b & a \\end{pmatrix}\\right)= a + ib.\\]\n\nIn a similar way we can represent quaternions as matrices. Quaternions were developed by the Irish mathematician Hamilton to solve problems in mechanics in three-dimensional space. They are an ‘extension’ of the complex numbers in the following way:\n\nLet \\(i,j,k\\) satisfy the rules \\(i^2 = j^2 = k^{2} = ijk =  -1\\), thus: \\[\\begin{eqnarray}\nij &=& k = -ji \\\\\njk &=& i = -kj \\\\\nki &=& j = -ik.\n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nSet \\(\\widehat{\\Hbb} := \\{ a + bi + cj + dk : a,b,c,d, \\in \\R \\}\\). Then \\(\\widehat{\\Hbb}\\) is a division ring.\n\nThe quaternions form a ring \\(\\widehat{\\Hbb}\\) and the group \\(Q_8\\) lives inside that ring. In a similar way to our representation of complex numbers as matrices with real entries, we can represent quaternions as matrices with complex entries:\n\nThe ring \\(\\widehat{\\Hbb}\\) is isomorphic to the ring \\[\\Hbb = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} z & w \\\\ - \\overline{w} & \\overline{z} \\end{pmatrix} : w,z \\in \\C  \\right\\}.\\] An isomorphism is the map \\(\\theta: \\widehat{\\Hbb} \\to \\Hbb\\) where \\[\\theta(a + bi + cj + dk) = \\begin{pmatrix} a + bi & c + di \\\\ -(c-di) & a-bi \\end{pmatrix}.\\] Notice that\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\theta(1) &=& \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = - \\theta(-1) \\\\\n\\theta(i) &=& \\begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\\\ 0 & -i \\end{pmatrix} = - \\theta(-i) \\\\\n\\theta(j) &=& \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = - \\theta(-j)\\\\\n\\theta(k) &=& \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}  = -\\theta(-k)\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nThus we have a representation of the quarternion group \\(Q_8\\) as a subgroup of \\(GL(2, \\C)\\) (invertible 2-by-2 matrices over the complex numbers).\n\nThen, as we have seen, the set of all such matrices forms a subring of the ring of all \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrices with entries from \\(\\C\\). In fact, it forms a division ring.",

We are, though, interested in cases where we do have commutativity; this leads to the following definition:\n\nDefinition 9.8 (Field) A field is a commutative division ring.\n\n\n\nThe rings \\(\\Q, \\R\\) and \\(\\C\\) are all fields; \\(\\Z\\) is not a fields (it is not a division ring).\n\n\n\nLet \\(F\\) be a field. Then \\((F\\backslash \\{0_{R} \\}, \\times)\\) is an abelian group. Thus a ring \\(R\\) is a field if \\((R,+)\\) and \\((R\\backslash{0_{R}},\\times)\\) are both abelian groups.\n\n\n9.4.1 Properties of Fields\n\nEvery field is an integral domain.\n\n\nProof. \n\nLet \\(F\\) be a field. To show that \\(F\\) is a field it suffices to show that it has no zero divisors. Let \\(x\\in F \\backslash \\{0_{F}\\}\\) and suppose there is a \\(y \\in F\\) such that that \\(xy = 0_{F}\\). Since \\(F\\) is a field, and \\(x\\) is nonzero \\(x\\) has a multiplicative inverse \\(x^{-1} \\in F\\). Then, \\[y  = 1_{F}y = (x^{-1}x)y = (x^{-1}) 0_{F} = 0_{F}.\\] Thus \\(F\\) has no zero divisors: if a product \\(xy = 0\\), one of \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) must be zero.\n\n\n\nDefinition 9.9 (Characteristic) Let \\(R\\) be an integral domain. The characteristic of \\(R\\), denoted \\(\\text{char}\\,(R)\\), is the period of \\(1_R\\) in the group \\((R, +)\\). If \\(1_R\\) has infinite period in the group \\((R, +)\\) then we define \\(\\text{char}\\,(R)=0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\chr(\\R) = 0\\);\n\\(\\chr(\\zn) = n\\);\n\\(\\chr(\\Q) = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(R\\) be an integral domain. Then \\(\\text{char}\\,(R)\\) is either zero or a prime.\n\n\nProof. \n\nSuppose \\(\\chr(R) = m \\ne 0\\). Let \\(k,l \\in \\N\\) such that \\(kl = m\\). For a positive integer \\(a\\) write \\(a1_{R}\\) for the sum \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{a} 1_{R}\\). Then \\[m1 = kl(1_{R}) = (k1_{r})(l1_{r}) = 0_{R}.\\]\nSince \\(R\\) is an integral domain, it must be that either \\(k1_{R} = 0_{R}\\) or \\(l1_{r} = 0_{R}\\). Since \\(m = \\chr{R}\\) and \\(1 \\le k,l \\le m\\), we conclude that either \\(k =m\\) or \\(l =m\\). Thus \\(m\\) is divisible only by itself and \\(1\\) — \\(m\\) is prime.\n\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that any field has a subfield that is isomorphic to either \\(\\Q\\) or \\(\\Z_p\\). We find that any field with characteristic \\(p\\) has a copy of \\(\\Z_p\\) ‘inside it’, whilst any field with characteristic 0 has a copy of \\(\\Q\\) ‘inside it’.\n\n\n9.4.2 Field Extensions\nConsider the polynomial \\(x^2-2\\) in \\(\\Q\\). What happens if we try to factorise it?\n\n\\(x^2 -2 = (x + \\sqrt{2})(x- \\sqrt{2})\\). However, \\(\\sqrt{2} \\not\\in \\Q\\) so \\(x^2 -2\\) is not factorisable in \\(\\Q\\). One potential way to resolve this is to extend \\(\\Q\\) to include all the irrational numbers.\n\nThis ‘field extension’ gives us the set of real numbers, \\(\\R\\). In a similar way, consider the polynomial \\(x^2+1\\) in \\(\\R\\).\n\n\\(x^2 +1 = (x + i)(x- i)\\). However, \\(i \\not\\in \\R\\) so \\(x^2 +1\\) is not factorisable in \\(\\R\\). One potential way to resolve this is to extend \\(\\R\\) to include all numbers of the form \\(a+ib\\) where \\(a,b \\in \\R\\).\n\nReturning to the first example, one obvious question to ask is whether the extension of \\(\\Q\\) to the whole of \\(\\R\\) is the ‘smallest’ possible extension that makes \\(x^2 -2\\) factorisable. The answer is ‘no’.\n\nDefine a field \\(\\Q(\\sqrt{2}) = \\{a + b \\sqrt{2} | a,b \\in \\Q\\}\\). Clearly \\(\\sqrt{2} \\in \\Q(\\sqrt{2})\\) and so \\(x^2 -2\\) can be factorised in \\(\\Q(\\sqrt{2})\\). Notationally we write \\(\\Q(\\sqrt{2})| \\Q\\) to indicate that this is an extension of \\(\\Q\\).\nWe can similarly extend \\(\\Q\\) in order to factorise say \\(x^2 -6\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside\n\n\n\nThe field \\(\\Q(\\sqrt{2})|\\Q\\) is a vector space over \\(\\Q\\) with basis \\((1, \\sqrt{2})\\).\n\n\n\nNote that this extension is a field in its own right (see Problem Set 7) and sits inside \\(\\R\\). In fact it is a subfield of \\(\\R\\), but it is clearly not all of \\(\\R\\).\nSuch extensions of \\(\\Q\\) are known as algebraic number fields. We say that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is an algebraic element in \\(\\Q(\\sqrt{2}) \\where \\Q\\) (and, indeed, in \\(\\R \\where \\Q)\\) as it is a root of the equation \\(x^2=2\\). In a similar way, \\(i\\) is an algebraic element in \\(\\C \\where \\R\\) as it is a root of the equation \\(x^2=-1\\). On the other hand, \\(e\\) is not an algebraic element in \\(\\R \\where \\Q\\) since there is no polynomial with rational coefficients that has \\(e\\) as a root.\nWe are now beginning to stray into the beginnings of Galois theory, a beautiful area of mathematics that explores the connection between group theory and field theory. This tells us why there are general formulae for solving quadratics, cubics and quartics, but not for polynomials of degree five or greater. It also gives us a characterisation of the ratios of lengths that can be constructed using only straightedge and compasses, thus leading to an elegant insight into the theory of constructible regular polygons. In fact it can be argued that the work of Galois, all completed before the age of 21 when he died, saw the birth of Abstract Algebra as a coherent mathematical discipline.",

Prove that \\(\\Q (\\sqrt 2)\\) is a field.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 9.3\n\n\n\n\nSolution 9.3\n\n\nBefore tackling a problem like this it is always helpful to have a strategy. Recall that a field is a commutative division ring and that a division ring is a (not necessarily commutative) ring in which every non-zero element is a unit. So, the strategy is to show that \\(\\QR\\) is a ring (what’s the easy way?) and then demonstrate that it is commutative and that all non-zero elements have multiplicative inverses.\nTo show that \\(\\QR\\) is a ring is straightforward if we note that \\(\\QR\\) is a subset of \\(\\R\\); all we need to do is show that \\(\\QR\\) is a subring of \\(\\R\\).\n\nWe have that \\(1 = 1 + 0 \\sqrt 2 \\in \\QR\\) and clearly \\(1\\) acts as an identity element in \\(\\QR\\).\nLet \\(x = a + b \\sqrt 2,\\; y = c + d \\sqrt 2 \\in \\QR\\), ; \\(a, b, c, d \\in \\Q\\). Then \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nx - y &=& (a + b \\sqrt 2) - (c + d \\sqrt 2)\\\\\n&=& a - c + (b-d) \\sqrt 2 \\; \\in \\QR \\qquad \\text{as $a-c, \\; b-d \\; \\in \\Q.$}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] Hence, \\(\\QR\\) is closed under subtraction.\nLet \\(x = a + b \\sqrt 2,\\; y = c + d \\sqrt 2 \\in \\QR\\), ; \\(a, b, c, d \\in \\Q\\). Then \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n      xy &=& (a + b \\sqrt 2)(c + d \\sqrt 2)\\\\\n      &=& (ac +2bd) + (ad + bc) \\sqrt 2 \\; \\in \\QR \\qquad \\text{as $ac+2bd, \\; ad+bc \\; \\in \\Q.$}\n      \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Hence, \\(\\QR\\) is closed under multiplication.\n\nThus, by i. to iii. above, \\(\\QR\\) is a subring of \\(\\R\\) and, hence, a ring.\nAs mentioned, to now show that \\(\\QR\\) is a field, we need to demonstrate that it is commutative and that every non-zero element is a unit.\nClearly commutativity follows from the fact that \\(\\QR\\) is a subset of \\(\\R\\), and \\(\\R\\) is commutative.\nChecking that each non-zero element is a unit needs care — we require that all non-zero elements of \\(\\QR\\) have an inverse in \\(\\QR\\).\nIt is useful, for illustration purposes, to consider a specific, numerical example. Suppose that we consider \\(1 + 2 \\sqrt2 \\in \\QR\\). Now consider the conjugate \\(1 - 2 \\sqrt 2 \\in \\QR\\). Then \\[(1 + 2 \\sqrt2)(1 - 2 \\sqrt2) = 1^2 - (2 \\sqrt2)^2 = 1 - 8 = -7.\\] Now, it follows that \\((1 + 2 \\sqrt2)(1 - 2 \\sqrt2)(-\\frac{1}{7}) = 1\\) and, hence, we have that \\[(1 + 2 \\sqrt2)^{-1} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{7}\\right)(1 - 2 \\sqrt2) = \\frac{1}{(1^2 - (2\\sqrt2)^2)}(1 - 2 \\sqrt2).\\] Checking:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n(1 + 2 \\sqrt2)\\left(-\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{2 \\sqrt 2}{7}\\right) &=& -\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{2}{7}\\sqrt2 - \\frac{2}{7}\\sqrt2 + \\frac{4 \\sqrt2}{7}\\sqrt2\\\\\n&=& -\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{8}{7}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{7}{7}\\\\\n&=& 1\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nWe now consider the general case. Let \\(0 \\neq x = a + b \\sqrt2 \\in \\QR\\). Consider the conjugate \\(y = a - b\\sqrt2 \\in \\QR\\). Then \\((a + b\\sqrt2)(a - b\\sqrt2) = a^2 - 2b^2 \\in \\Q\\). So, in order to get the identity, \\(1\\), from \\(x\\), we simply need to multiply \\(x\\) by \\[\\frac{1}{a^2 - 2b^2}(a - b\\sqrt2) \\in \\QR.\\] But, could \\(a^2 - 2b^2 = 0\\)?\nIt is easy to see that the only solution to the equation \\(a^2 - 2b^2 = 0\\), with \\(a, b \\in \\Q\\) is \\(a=b=0\\). Hence, for all \\(0 \\neq x = a + b\\sqrt2 \\in \\QR\\) then \\(a^2 = 2b^2 \\neq 0\\) and we have \\[x^{-1} = \\frac{1}{a^2 - 2b^2}(a - b \\sqrt2) \\in \\QR, \\;\\;\\; \\forall \\, x \\in \\QR.\\] So, \\(\\QR\\) is a field.",
