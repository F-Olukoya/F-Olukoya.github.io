A key idea from MAT-20025: Abstract Algebra is that groups are an abstraction of symmetry.\nThis module picks up where MAT-20025 left-off. We go over the essential definitions, introduce canonical examples and continue on to develop a structural understanding of finite groups. The main aim of the course is to give a proof of the seminal Sylow Theorems.",

    "text": "1.1 Basic ideas\nIn the second year Abstract Algebra module we gave the formal definition of a group:\nA group with the additional property that \\[\\forall x, y \\in G, x * y = y * x\\] is called abelian. You were given lots of examples of structures which satisfy the group axioms. Some of these were infinite and abelian (for example \\((\\Z, +)\\), \\((\\R, +)\\), \\((\\R \\backslash \\{0\\}, \\times)\\), and \\((\\C \\backslash \\{0\\}, \\times)\\)), some were infinite and non-abelian (for example, \\(GL(n, \\R)\\) under matrix multiplication), some were finite and abelian (for example, \\(\\Z_n\\) and \\(\\Z^{\\times}_m\\)), and some were finite and non-abelian (for example, \\(D_n\\), the group of symmetries of a regular \\(n\\)-gon).\nInitially, we would write groups in the form \\((G, *)\\) to emphasise the fact that a group is a pair, namely a set of objects and a binary operation defined on that set. In this module we shall, largely, relax that formality and refer to groups simply by the name of the set where there is no ambiguity with regard to the binary operation.\nIn this module we shall use the notation \\(H \\leq G\\) to denote that \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\).\nTo check whether a subset of group elements forms a subgroup we need, in the case of infinite groups, to check that the subset is closed under the group binary operation and that every element of \\(H\\) has an inverse in \\(H\\). For finite groups we need only check closure.\nLagrange’s Theorem states that the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. The converse is not true for groups in general, but is true for abelian groups.\nRecall that for any group element, the set formed by taking all integer powers of that element forms a subgroup. Notationally, if \\(\\gx\\) is a group and \\(a \\in G\\), then the set \\(\\{ a^n \\where n \\in \\Z \\}\\) forms a subgroup of \\(\\gx\\) called the cyclic subgroup generated by \\(a\\) and denoted \\(\\langle a \\rangle\\).\nNote that if \\(\\gx\\) is a cyclic group with generator \\(a\\), then the order of \\(G\\) is the same as the period of \\(a\\) in \\(G\\). In addition, note that the order of a cyclic subgroup generated by \\(a \\in G\\) is the same as the period of \\(a\\) in \\(G\\). For this reason we shall not refer to the period of an element in a group, but, more naturally, to its order (though they mean the same thing). Recall, also, that if \\(\\gx\\) is a finite group of prime order, then it must be cyclic.\nAn important consequence of Lagrange’s theorem is that the order of any element in a group must divide the order of the group.\nYou were then told that any finite group could be completely described by its operation, or Cayley, table.\n\\(\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n&0\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\hspace{1cm}\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n&0&1\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&1\\\\\n1&1&0\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\hspace{1cm}\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n&0&1&2\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&1&2\\\\\n1&1&2&0\\\\\n2&2&0&1\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\hspace{1cm}\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n&0&1&2&3\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&1&2&3\\\\\n1&1&2&3&0\\\\\n2&2&3&0&1\\\\\n3&3&0&1&2\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\hspace{1cm}\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n&0&1&2&3\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&1&2&3\\\\\n1&1&0&3&2\\\\\n2&2&3&0&1\\\\\n3&3&2&1&0\n\\end{array}\\\\\\\\\n{\\Z}_1&\\hspace{1cm} {\\Z}_2&\\hspace{1cm} {\\Z}_3&\\hspace{1cm}\\Z_4&\\hspace{1cm}\\Z_2\\times\\Z_2\n\\end{array}\\)\n\\(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n&0&1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&1&2&3&4\\\\\n1&1&2&3&4&0\\\\\n2&2&3&4&0&1\\\\\n3&3&4&0&1&2\\\\\n4&4&0&1&2&3\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\hspace{1cm}\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n&0&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n1&1&2&3&4&5&0\\\\\n2&2&3&4&5&0&1\\\\\n3&3&4&5&0&1&2\\\\\n4&4&5&0&1&2&3\\\\\n5&5&0&1&2&3&4\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\hspace{1cm}\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n&0&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n\\hline\n0&0&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n1&1&2&0&5&3&4\\\\\n2&2&0&1&4&5&3\\\\\n3&3&4&5&0&1&2\\\\\n4&4&5&3&2&0&1\\\\\n5&5&3&4&1&2&0\n\\end{array}\\\\\\\\\n\\Z_5&\\hspace{1cm}{\\Z}_6&\\hspace{1cm}S_3\\cong D_3\n\\end{array}\\)\nHere we have chosen to use the set \\(\\{0, 1, \\ldots , n-1 \\}\\) to denote the group elements. This is a natural choice when representing the cyclic group of order \\(n\\) because the Cayley table corresponds to the operation table for addition modulo \\(n\\), but for the non-cyclic groups, \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\) and \\(S_3\\), no particular meaning should be ascribed to these symbols. Indeed, we may take any of these groups and replace the symbols with \\(a, b, c, \\ldots\\) or Cat, Dog, Goldfish, … to obtain a group which, although formally different to the original group (because the underlying set is different) is ‘essentially the same’. This concept of two structures being ‘essentially the same’ is called isomorphism.\nAn important skill in pure mathematics is to see through the formalism of statements and definitions and understand what is being said. If you do this then concepts will become natural (maybe even obvious) and you will not need to remember very much. Isomorphism is a case in point. If we want to capture the idea that the elements of the Cayley table of one group can be relabelled so as to obtain the Cayley table of another group (subject to some possible rearrangement of the rows and/or columns), then we need to replace each symbol of the first group with a symbol from the second group. This relabelling is exactly what a bijection achieves (make sure you understand why it needs to be both injective and surjective) and, if the resulting Cayley tables are going to be the same, we require the additional property that\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n*&&y&\\\\\n\\hline\n&&\\vdots&\\\\\nx&\\cdots&z&\\\\\n&&&\n\\end{array}\n\\hspace{1cm}\n\\longmapsto\n\\hspace{1cm}\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\odot&&\\theta(y)&\\\\\n\\hline\n&&\\vdots&\\\\\n\\theta(x)&\\cdots&\\theta(z)&\\\\\n&&&\n\\end{array}\\]\nOr, in other words, \\(\\theta (x*y) = \\theta (x) \\odot \\theta (y)\\). Note that if \\(\\theta\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G_1\\) to \\(G_2\\) then \\(\\theta^{-1}\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G_2\\) to \\(G_1\\), so we say that \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) are isomorphic and write \\(G_1 \\cong G_2\\). It is important to understand the relationship between cyclic and abelian; if a group is cyclic then it is abelian, but the converse does not necessarily hold. Consider \\(\\Z^{\\times}_{12}\\), which has the following operation table:\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\otimes_{12}&1&5&7&11\\\\\n\\hline\n1&1&5&7&11\\\\\n5&5&1&11&7\\\\\n7&7&11&1&5\\\\\n11&11&7&5&1\n\\end{array}\\] Clearly the group is abelian (since the operation involves only the multiplication of integers), but note that all non-identity elements have period 2, so the group cannot be cyclic (since the generator of a cyclic group must have period equal to the order of the group).\nIf in Definition 1.5, we remove condition a. then the resulting map \\(\\theta\\) is what is called a homomorphism. In particular, homomorphisms preserve the ‘multiplicative structure’ but not necessarily the size. More formally, we have:\nLeft (or right) cosets are an extremely important concept in this module; in fact, much of the material from Chapter 4 onwards is centred around the idea of groups where the elements of the set are themselves cosets (the so-called quotient groups).",

    "section": "1.2 Equivalence Relations",
    "text": "1.2 Equivalence Relations\nIn first-year Algebra, and Abstract Algebra last year, we used the concept of integers being congruent, or equivalent, to each other modulo some given integer. Formally we have the following:\n\nDefinition 1.8 (Congruence of Integers) Let \\(a, b, n\\) be integers, \\(n &gt; 0\\). Then \\(a\\) is congruent to \\(b\\) modulo \\(n\\) if and only if \\(n \\divides (b-a)\\).\n\nNotationally, we write that \\(a \\equiv b \\modu n)\\). Recall, also, that if two integers are equivalent to each other modulo \\(n\\), that is the same as saying that they both leave the same principal remainder on division by \\(n\\). In Abstract Algebra we took this one step further and defined a residue class as follows:\n\nDefinition 1.9 (Residue Class) Let \\(a, n\\) be integers, \\(n\\) positive. The residue class \\([a]_n\\) of \\(a\\) modulo \\(n\\) is the set of all integers congruent to \\(a\\) modulo \\(n\\). (Or, the equivalence class containing \\(a\\) under congruence modulo \\(n\\).). That is, \\[[a]_n = \\{m \\where m \\in \\Z, m \\equiv a \\modu n) \\} = \\{a+kn \\where k \\in \\Z \\}.\\]\n\n\nExample 1.3  \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  [5]_6 &= \\{5+6k | k \\in \\Z\\} = \\{\\ldots, -7, -1,5,11,17, \\ldots \\}\\\\\n  [0]_5 &= \\{5k | k \\in \\Z\\} = \\{ \\ldots, -10,-5,0,5,10,\\ldots\\}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nWe note two things about these residue classes. First, for any integers \\(a, b, c\\), then \\(a\\) is in the same class as itself; if \\(a\\) is in the same class as \\(b\\) then \\(b\\) is in the same class as \\(a\\); if \\(a\\) is in the same class as \\(b\\) and \\(b\\) in the same class as \\(c\\) then \\(a\\) is in the same class as \\(c\\). Second, for any given \\(n\\), the classes partition the set of integers into disjoint sets where every integer is in exactly one of the residue (or equivalence) classes.\n\nExample 1.4  \n\nConsider \\([3]_4\\) \\[\n   [3]_{4} = \\{3+ 4k | k \\in \\Z \\} = \\{ \\ldots, -9,-5,-1,3,7,11,15,\\ldots\\}\n  \\]\nIt is clear that \\(7\\) is contained in its equivalence class. The following are also straightforward\n\nas \\(3\\) is in the same equivalence class as \\(19\\), then \\(19\\) is in the same equivalence class as \\(3\\);\nAs \\(-5\\) is in the same equivalence class as \\(7\\), and \\(7\\) is in the same equivalence class as \\(11\\), then \\(-5\\) is in the same equivalence class as \\(11\\).\n\nThe second property is illustrated below:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    [0]_3 &= \\{\\ldots, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, \\ldots \\} \\\\\n    [1]_3 &= \\{\\ldots, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, 10, \\ldots \\} \\\\\n    [2]_3 &= \\{\\ldots, -4, -1, 2,5, 8,11 \\ldots \\}\n  \\end{align*}\\]\nSo ‘equivalence modulo’ \\(3\\) partitions the integers into three disjoint sets — every integer is in one and only one of the 3 sets.\n\n\nWe can formalise these two ideas as follows.\n\nDefinition 1.10 (Relation) A relation, \\(R\\), on a non-empty set \\(S\\) is a non-empty subset of the Cartesian product \\(S \\times S\\).\n\nNote that, as a consequence of this definition, \\(R\\) is a set of ordered pairs of elements from \\(S\\), but rather than specifying a subset \\(R\\) of \\(S \\times S\\), it is usual to specify a rule for when \\((a, b) \\in R\\), where \\(a, b \\in S\\). We write \\(aRb\\) rather than \\((a, b) \\in R\\) and read this as \\(a\\) is related to \\(b\\) (under the relation \\(R\\)).\n\nExample 1.5 The following are examples of relations.\n\nLet \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}\\) and define a relation on \\(S\\) such that for all \\(a, b \\in S, \\; aRb \\ifif \\frac{a-b}{2} \\in \\Z\\).\n\nSo \\(1R1\\) as \\((1-1)/2 = 0 \\in \\Z\\); \\(2R6\\) as \\((2-6)/2 = -2 \\in \\Z\\). However, \\(3 {R \\mkern -11mu/} 4\\) since \\((3-4)/2 = -1/2 \\notin \\Z\\).\n\nDefine the relation \\(R = \\{ (x, y) \\where x \\in \\Z^+, y \\in \\Z^+, x \\neq y \\; \\text{and} \\; x^y = y^x \\}\\). What does \\(R\\) contain?\n\nIn fact \\(R\\) is finite and has only \\(2\\) elements: \\[R = \\{(2,4),(4,2)\\}.\\]\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.11 (Equivalence Relation) A relation, \\(R\\), on a non-empty set \\(S\\) is said to be an equivalence relation if and only if, for all \\(a, b, c \\in S\\),\n\n\\(aRa\\) for all \\(a \\in S\\) (the relation is reflexive) and\nwhenever \\(aRb\\), then \\(bRa\\) (the relation is symmetric) and\nwhenever \\(aRb\\) and \\(bRc\\), then \\(aRc\\) (the relation is transitive).\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.12 (Partition) A partition of a set, \\(S\\), is a collection, \\(P\\), of non-empty subsets of \\(S\\) such that every element of \\(S\\) is in exactly one member of \\(P\\).\n\nNote that each member of \\(P\\) is, in itself, a set.\n\nTheorem 1.1 Let \\(R\\) be an equivalence relation defined on a set \\(S\\) and define \\[[a] = \\{b \\in S \\where bRa \\}.\\] Then, \\(\\{ [a] \\where a \\in S \\}\\) is a partition of \\(S\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nWe need to show that every element of \\(S\\) belongs to one of these sets and also that any two such sets which have an element in common must in fact be equal.\nLet \\(a \\in S\\) be arbitrary. Since \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation, it is reflexive and so \\(aRa\\) holds. Therefore, by definition, \\(a \\in [a]\\). Since \\(a\\) was arbitrarily chosen, we conclude that for all \\(a \\in S\\) \\(a \\in [a]\\).\nNow let \\(a,b \\in S\\) and suppose that \\([a]\\) and \\([b]\\) have a point \\(c\\) in common, that is \\[ c \\in [a] \\cap [b].\\] Let \\(a' \\in [a]\\) be chosen arbitrarily. Since \\(a'\\) and \\(c'\\) are in \\([a]\\) it follows that \\(a' R a\\) and \\(c Ra\\). Since \\(R\\) is a symmetric relation we deduce that \\(a R c\\) is true as well. Since \\(R\\) is transitive, the statements \\(a' Ra\\) and \\(aRc\\) now mean that \\(a' R c\\). Using the fact that \\(c \\in [b]\\) we have \\(c Rb\\). Applying symmetry again we deduce that \\(b Rc\\) is true also. Transitivity, from the statements \\(a' R c\\) and \\(c R b\\), now implies that \\(a' R b\\). By definition it follows that \\(a' \\in [b]\\). Since \\(a' \\in [a]\\) was arbitrarily chosen we conclude that \\([a] \\subseteq [b]\\).\nSwapping the roles of \\([a]\\) and \\([b]\\) above, we see that \\([b] \\subseteq [a]\\) as well. Therefore \\([a] = [b]\\) as required.\n\n\nWe will often refer to each of the members of a partition as an equivalence class. Note that, as a consequence of the above, residue classes are defined by an equivalence relation on the set of integers and, therefore, partition the set of integers. We now return to the property of isomorphism. It is obvious that any group is isomorphic to itself. Furthermore, if \\(\\theta\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G_1\\) to \\(G_2\\) then we have noted that \\(\\theta^{-1}\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G_2\\) to \\(G_1\\); so if \\(G_1 \\cong G_2\\) then \\(G_2 \\cong G_1\\). An extension of this argument then leads us to the conclusion that if \\(G_1 \\cong G_2\\) and \\(G_2 \\cong G_3\\), then \\(G_1 \\cong G_3\\). Thus isomorphism is an equivalence relation on the collection of all groups (the collection of all groups is technically not a proper set). Now let us consider left coset formation. You will recall that we used a direct argument in Abstract Algebra to show that left cosets partition the group elements (and, along with two other properties we used this to prove Lagrange’s Theorem). This means, therefore, that left coset formation must be an equivalence relation on the set of group elements and if we can define such an equivalence relation we would have an alternative proof to Lagrange’s Theorem. So, let \\(G\\) be a finite group and \\(H\\) be a subgroup of \\(G\\). Consider \\(a, b \\in G\\). We need to find a relation that describes the property of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) lying in the same left coset of \\(H\\) as each other, that is, \\(a\\) is related to \\(b\\) if and only if both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the same left coset of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\). Now, since for any subgroup \\(H\\) we have that \\(e \\in H\\), it follows that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the same left coset of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\) if and only if \\(aH=bH\\) and, hence, \\(ah_1=bh_2\\) for some \\(h_1, h_2 \\in H\\). Now,\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n&ah_1 = bh_2\\\\\n\\iff &a= bh_2 h-1^{-1} \\\\\n\\iff &b^{-1}a =h_2h_1^{-1} \\\\\n\\iff &b^{-1}a \\in H\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nThe last step follows from the fact that if \\(h_1, h_2 \\in H\\), then since \\(H\\) is itself a group it is closed under product and inverse and, hence, \\(h_2h_1^{-1} \\in H\\). Then it follows that \\(b^{-1}a \\in H\\) and, hence, we must have that for any two group elements \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), they are in the same coset if and only if \\(y^{-1}x \\in H\\), for the given subgroup \\(H\\). (This is just a relabelling where \\(x=a\\) and \\(y=b\\)). So we can now define our relation that results in coset formation as follows: let \\(H\\) be a subgroup of a finite group \\(G\\) and let \\(x, y \\in G\\), then \\(xRy\\) if and only if \\(y^{-1}x \\in H\\). We now need to show that this is indeed an equivalence relation.\n\nReflexive:\n\n\\[x^{-1}x = e \\in H \\implies xRx \\forall x \\in G\\]\n\nSymmetric:\n\n\\[y^{-1}x \\in H \\iff (y^{-1}x)^{-1} \\in H \\iff x^{-1}y \\in H \\iff yRx\\]\n\nTransitive:\n\nSuppose \\(xRy\\) and \\(yRx\\), then \\(y^{-1}x \\in H\\) and \\(z^{-1}y \\in H\\). This means that \\((z^{-1}y)(y^{-1}x) \\in H\\). Therefore \\(z^{-1}x \\in H\\) and \\(xRz\\).\n\n\nWe have established that left coset formation is an equivalence relation, so we now know that it must partition the group. We also know, from Abstract Algebra, that the size of every coset is equal to the size of \\(H\\) and, therefore, we can conclude that the size of \\(H\\) must divide the size of \\(G\\).\nThe above also gives us a checking lemma to determine whether two left cosets are equal. It uses the fact that two left cosets are either disjoint or identical and that \\(g \\in gH\\).\n\nLemma 1.1 Let \\(H\\) be a subgroup of \\(G\\) and \\(g_1, g_2 \\in G\\). Then \\[g_1H = g_2H \\ifif g_1^{-1}g_2 \\in H.\\]\n\n\nProof. \n\nSuppose \\(g_1H = g_2H\\). Note that \\(g_2 \\in g_2 H\\) since \\(g_2 = g_2 e\\) and \\(e \\in H\\). Since \\(g_1H = g_2 H\\) there is an element \\(h \\in H\\) such that \\(g_1h = g_2\\). Therefore \\(h = g_1^{-1}g_2\\) and so \\(g_1^{-1}g_2 \\in H\\) as required.\nOn the other hand, suppose \\(g_1^{-1}g_2 \\in H\\). Let \\(h \\in H\\), then \\[g_1h = eh= (g_2g_2^{-1})g_1h = g_2(g_2^{-1}g_{1})h = g_2((g_2^{-1}g_1)h) \\in g_2 H\\] since \\(g_2^{-1}g_1 = (g_1^{-1}g_2)^{-1} \\in H\\). Similarly, \\[g_2h = g_1(g_1^{-1}g_2)h \\in g_1 H.\\]\nSince \\(h \\in H\\) was chosen arbitrarily, we conclude that \\(g_1H = g_2H\\).",

    "text": "1.3 An Idea of What is to Come\nEarlier we presented the Cayley tables of all the isomorphically distinct groups up to order 6, by which we mean that any group of order less than or equal to 6 is isomorphic to exactly one group in that list. The fundamental problem of Group Theory is to produce such a catalogue for all groups, or perhaps just all finite groups. Clearly it is not possible, nor particularly helpful, to produce an infinite list of Cayley tables, but for a given order \\(n\\) can we describe or generate all of the isomorphically distinct groups of that order? We know this is possible for all of the finite abelian groups, by way of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, so, it is the non-abelian groups that cause all the trouble in terms of trying to establish a classification. The most celebrated result in Group Theory is the classification of all finite simple groups. Simple groups will be defined later, but are the building blocks of all finite groups in much the same way that the primes are the building blocks of the positive integers. This classification theorem is the result of over 100 years’ work by thousands of group theorists and it is estimated that its complete proof (if ever assembled in one place) would require about 20,000 pages! In this module we will prove some classification and structure theorems, but we will also look at how groups arise naturally (albeit in some unexpected places). In doing so we shall be looking at the forms that different groups can take - in particular their actions, presentations and representations. The first unexpected place that group theory arises is in the bedroom….",

Being a frugal individual I wish to maximise the amount of use that I get from my mattress so it is necessary to turn the mattress at regular intervals (say once a month) so as to promote uniform wear. Obviously any turning of the mattress must result in the mattress fitting back onto the bed as intended and, therefore, we can consider this problem in terms of the symmetries of a rectangle (assuming that the mattress is not square!) where the mattress represents the rectangle and the base of the bed represents the two-dimensional plane. Now, we know that the symmetry group of a rectangle is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\) (there are only two groups, up to isomorphism, of order 4 and the other is cyclic) and hence there are four positions for the mattress, or one per month for a four-month period. The symmetries are a rotation of \\(180^{\\circ}\\) degrees, a ‘flip’ about the short axis, and a ‘flip’ about the long axis. Suppose we designate as \\(A\\) the \\(180^{\\circ}\\) rotation (where the mattress remains face up), as \\(B\\) the ‘flip’ in the long axis of symmetry, and as \\(C\\) the ‘flip’ in the short axis of symmetry.

If \\(a\\) is an element of \\(G\\), and has finite period \\(k\\) in \\(G\\), then this subgroup is \\[\\langle a \\rangle = \\{e, a, a^2, \\ldots, a^{k-1}\\}.\\] Since this subgroup has order \\(k\\), the element \\(a\\) has order \\(k\\) (some authors write \\(|a| = k\\)). If there is an element \\(a \\in G\\) such that \\(\\langle a \\rangle  = G\\), then, as we know, \\(G\\) is a cyclic group and \\(a\\) is a generator of \\(G\\). Clearly \\(\\langle a \\rangle\\) is the smallest subgroup of \\(G\\) containing \\(a\\) in the sense that every subgroup of \\(G\\) which contains \\(a\\) must also contain \\(\\langle a \\rangle\\). We can generalise this to any subset of elements of \\(G\\).\nWe can generalise this to the following:\n\nDefinition 1.13 Let \\(G\\) be a group and let \\(S = \\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots \\}\\) be a subset of the elements of \\(G\\). The subgroup generated by \\(S\\) is the smallest subgroup of \\(G\\) containing \\(S\\) (we denote this \\(\\langle S \\rangle = \\langle a_1, a_2, \\ldots \\rangle\\). If this subgroup is all of \\(G\\) then \\(S\\) generates \\(G\\) and the \\(a_i\\) are generators of \\(G\\). If there is a finite set, \\(S\\), which generates \\(G\\), then \\(G\\) is finitely generated.\n\nSo, given a group \\(G\\) and a subset of elements \\(S\\), what does the subgroup generated by \\(S\\) look like? The following theorem answers this question.\n\nTheorem 1.2 If \\(G\\) is a group and \\(S = \\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots \\}\\) a subset of the elements of \\(G\\), then the subgroup \\(\\langle S \\rangle\\) of \\(G\\) consists of those elements of \\(G\\) that are finite products of integral powers of the \\(a_i\\) (where powers of a given \\(a_i\\) may occur several times in the product).\n\n\nProof. \n\nFirst observe that a finite product of integral powers of elements of \\(S\\) must be contained in \\(\\langle S \\rangle\\) since \\(S\\) is contained in \\(\\langle S \\rangle\\). It therefore suffices to show that the set \\(H\\) of finite produces integral powers of elements of \\(S\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\). This is because the set \\(H\\) would then be a subgroup of \\(G\\) containing \\(S\\) that is a subset of \\(\\langle S \\rangle\\), as \\(\\langle S \\rangle\\) is the smallest subgroup of \\(G\\) containing \\(S\\) it must therefore be equal to \\(H\\).\nWe check the subgroup criteria hold for \\(H\\).\n\nFor any \\(a \\in S\\), \\(a^0 = e \\in H\\), so \\(H\\) is non-empty and contains the identity of \\(G\\).\nBy definition \\(H\\) is closed under products.\n\\(H\\) is closed under inverses since the inverse of a finite product of integral powers of elements of \\(S\\) is again a finite product of integral powers of elements of \\(S\\).\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.6  \n\nConsider \\(D_4\\). Note that \\(D_4\\) is not a cyclic group since it cannot be generated by a single element (the order of \\(D_4\\) is \\(8\\) and the order of an element of \\(D_4\\) is either \\(2\\) or \\(4\\)). However \\(D_4\\) can be generated using a proper subset of elements of \\(D_4\\).\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccccccc}\n\\circ&e&r_1&r_2&r_3&s_1&s_2&s_3&s_4\\\\\n\\hline\ne&e&r_1&r_2&r_3&s_1&s_2&s_3&s_4\\\\\nr_1&r_1&r_2&r_3&e&s_4&s_1&s_2&s_3\\\\\nr_2&r_2&r_3&e&r_1&s_3&s_4&s_1&s_2\\\\\nr_3&r_3&e&r_1&r_2&s_2&s_3&s_4&s_1 \\\\\ns_1&s_1&s_2&s_3&s_4&e&r_1&r_2&r_3 \\\\\ns_2&s_2&s_3&s_4&s_1&r_3&e&r_1&r_2 \\\\\ns_3&s_3&s_4&s_1&s_2&r_2&r_3&e&r_1 \\\\\ns_4&s_4&s_1&s_2&s_3&r_1&r_2&r_3&e\n\\end{array}\\]\nLet \\(S = \\{r_1,s_2\\}\\).

    "section": "1.5 Presentations",
    "text": "1.5 Presentations\nIn essence, a group presentation is a notation that describes a group in terms of its generators and relations that hold between them. We begin with a definition.\n\nDefinition 1.14 (Presentation) A group can be described concisely by the notation \\[\\langle a, b \\ldots \\; | \\; \\text{list of relations between a, b, $\\ldots$ , and their powers}\\, \\rangle,\\] where the first part is a list of generators for the group and the second is a list of the relations that generate all the relations that hold between the generators. This notation is called a presentation of the group.\n\n\nExample 1.7 Consider the presentation \\[\\langle a, b \\; | \\; a^2 = b^2 = 1, ab = ba \\rangle.\\]\n\nThe generators both have order \\(2\\) and commute. This means that any finite product integral powers of the generators \\(a,b\\) can be reduced, using the relations, to the form \\(a^{i}b^{j}\\) where \\(i,j \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). Computing the operation table:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\ast & 1 & a & b & ab \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 1 & a & b & ab \\\\\na & a & 1 & ab & b \\\\\nb & b & ab & 1 & a \\\\\nab & ab & b & a & 1\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nObserve that the group is abelian and is in fact isomorphic to \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\).\n\n\n\nExample 1.8 Consider the presentation \\[\\langle a, b \\; | \\; a^3 = b^2 = 1, ab = ba^{-1} \\rangle.\\]\n\nThe generator \\(a\\) has order \\(3\\) and so has inverse \\(a^2\\); the generator \\(b\\) has order \\(2\\) and is its own inverse. The relation \\(ab=ba^{-1}\\) means we can move \\(b\\) to the left of \\(a\\) at the cost of replacing \\(a\\) with its inverse. Consequently, by repeatedly moving \\(b\\)’s to the left of \\(a\\)’s any finite product of integral powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be written in the from \\(b^{i}a^{j}\\) where \\(i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) and \\(j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}\\).\nWe can compute the operation table. \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n\\ast & 1 & a & a^2 & b & ba & ba^2 \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 1 & a & a^2 & b & ba & ba^2 \\\\\na & a & a^2 & 1 & ba^2 & b & ba \\\\\nb & b & ba & ba^2 & 1 & a & a^2 \\\\\nba & ba & ba^2 & a^2 & 1 & a & b \\\\\nba^2 & ba^2 & b & ba & a & a^2 & 1\n\\end{array}\n\\] Clearly this group is not abelian since \\(ba \\ne ab = ba^{2}\\).\n\n\nLooking at the above two presentations, we can see that the first is clearly abelian (because there are only two generators \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(ab = ba\\)), whereas the second is clearly non-abelian (because \\(ab = ba^{-1}\\) and \\(a^{-1} \\neq a\\)). In each case it was also easy to determine the order of each group and write out the group elements in some form. In the next two examples this is not so obvious.\n\nExample 1.9 \\(\\langle a, b \\; | \\; a^2 = b^2 = 1, (ab)^3 = 1 \\rangle.\\)\n\nNotice that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both have order \\(2\\) in this case. Further observe that since \\(ab ab ab = 1\\) then \\(bab = aba\\). Thus \\(baba = bbab=ab\\) and \\(abab= babb = ba\\). Any finite product of integral powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be written as a product of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)’s. Moreover, such a product cannot have consecutive \\(a\\)’s or consecutive \\(b\\)’s. Using the observation \\(baba =ab\\) and \\(abab = ba\\) we notice that such a product cannot exceed length \\(3\\). This leaves products of the form \\(a, ab,aba, b, ba\\). The multiplication table is now\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n\\ast & 1 & a & b & ab & ba & aba \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 1 & a & b & ab & ba & aba \\\\\na & a & 1 & ab & b & ab & ba \\\\\nb & b & ba & 1 & aba & a & ab \\\\\nba & ba & b & aba & 1 & ab & a \\\\\naba & aba & ab & ba & a & b & 1\n\\end{array}\n\\] Note that is group is isomorphic to \\(D_3\\). The reflections are \\(a,b\\) and \\(aba\\) and the rotations are powers of \\(ab\\).\n\n\n\nExample 1.10 \\(\\langle a, b \\; | \\; b^2a = b, ba^2b = a \\rangle.\\)\n\nThis group is the trivial group. From \\(b^2 a = b\\) we find that \\(ba =1\\). From \\(ba^2b =a\\) we find that \\(ab = a\\) and so \\(b =a\\). Using \\(ba=1\\) we see that \\(a=1\\) as well.\n\n\nA good presentation provides an efficient description of a group. For example, the dihedral group of order \\(2n\\), which is isomorphic to the symmetry group of a regular \\(n\\)-sided polygon, can be defined by the presentation \\[D_n = \\langle a, b \\; | \\; a^n = b^2 = 1, ba = a^{-1}b \\rangle.\\] It is easy to see that any product must belong to the set \\(\\{1, a, a^2, \\ldots, a^{n-1}, b, ab, a^2b, \\ldots, a^{n-1}b\\}\\) and any product may be reduced to an element of this set by reducing powers of \\(a\\) modulo \\(n\\), powers of \\(b\\) modulo 2, and bringing the \\(a\\)’s to the left, replacing \\(a\\) with \\(a^{-1}\\) when it `hops over’ a \\(b\\).\n\nExample 1.11  \n\nFor \\(D_6\\) we have \\[\\gen{a,b \\mid a^6=b^2=1, ba = a^{-1}b}.\\]\nGiven a product, for instance \\(a^{11}b^3 a^2b^{-1}a^{-1}b^4a\\), we can apply the relation to reduce it to the form \\(a^{i}b^{j}\\) for \\(0 \\le i \\le 5\\) and \\(0 \\le j &lt; 2\\).\n\\[\\begin{align*}\na^{11}b^3 a^2b^{-1}a^{-1}b^4a &= a^5 b a^2 b\\\\\n&= a^5 a^{-2}b^2 \\\\\n&= a^3\n\\end{align*}\\]",

Fundamentally, all groups can be thought of as consisting of infinitely many words but, using relations, we may be able to reduce each of these to a member of a (possibly finite) set. As we have seen, things are not always this easy. For a given presentation it can be difficult to determine the order of the group or even whether it is finite or infinite. This is summed up by the so called Word Problem for groups. The Word Problem is to find an algorithm which will determine whether two words represent the same element. We have such an algorithm for the dihedral group \\(D_n\\) because we have a way of reducing any given word to one of the \\(2n\\) elements of \\(\\{1, a, a^2, \\ldots, a^{n-1}, b, ab, a^2b,\\ldots, a^{n-1}b\\}\\). Hence two words are equal if and only if they reduce to the same element. It is hard to imagine that this would not be the case for any group presentation, but remarkably the Word Problem is known to be unsolvable in general.",

    "text": "1.7 Revision Sheet\nThis is a revision sheet and covers material from Abstract Algebra.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion R.1\n\n\nDefine \\(*\\) on \\(\\rwz\\) by \\(a*b=|a| \\, b\\) (so, for example \\(2*3=6, -2*3=6, 2*(-3)=-6\\) etc.).\n\nShow that \\(*\\) is an associative binary operation on \\(\\rwz\\).\nShow that there is an element \\(e \\in \\rwz\\) such that \\(e*x = x, \\; \\forall \\, x\\in \\rwz\\).\nShow that \\(\\forall \\, x\\in \\rwz, \\, \\exists \\, x^{-1}\\in\\rwz\\) such that \\(x*x^{-1}=e\\).\nIs \\((\\rwz,*)\\) a group?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution R.1\n\n\n\n\nSolution R.1\n\n\n\nWe have that, for all \\(x, y, z \\in \\rwz\\), \\[(x*y)*z = (|\\, x \\, | \\, y)*z = |\\, |\\, x \\, | \\, y\\, | z = |\\, xy \\, | z\\] and \\[x*(y*z) = x* (|\\, y \\, | \\, z) = | \\, x \\, | (|\\, y \\, | \\, z) = |\\, xy \\, | z.\\] Hence \\(*\\) is associative on \\(\\rwz\\).\nFor all \\(x \\in \\rwz\\) we have that \\(1*x = | \\, 1 \\, |x = x\\), so \\(e = 1\\). Note also, however, that \\(e = -1\\) also works.\nNote that \\(x * \\D\\frac{1}{| \\, x \\, |} = | \\, x \\, | \\frac{1}{| \\, x \\, |} = 1\\), so \\(x^{-1} = \\D\\frac{1}{| \\, x \\, |}\\).\nNo, it is not. There are a number of ways of deciding this.\n\nIn part ii. we noted that there were two values of \\(e\\) that would satisfy the relationship \\(e*x=x\\) for all \\(x \\in \\rwz\\), namely \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\). So both of these appear to have the property of an identity, but we know that in any group the identity is unique.\nWe also know that the identity in a group must commute with every element of the group, that is it must be `two-sided’ in the sense that it must satisfy \\(e*x = x*e = x\\). This is not the case here; for example, try \\(x = -3\\) (with \\(e=1\\) or \\(-1\\)) and note that \\(e*x  \\neq x*e\\).\nSimilarly, we can also see that the ‘inverse’ found in part iii. is not ‘two-sided’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion R.2\n\n\nIf \\(H\\) is a subgroup of a finite group \\(G\\) then the right coset of \\(H\\) by \\(g\\) is denoted and defined by \\[Hg=\\{hg \\, | \\, h\\in H\\}.\\] Prove Lagrange’s Theorem using right cosets (the proof using left cosets was given in the second year Abstract Algebra module). In other words, show that every right coset, \\(Hg\\), of \\(H\\) is the same size as \\(H\\), that two right cosets of \\(H\\) are either disjoint or equal, and that every element of \\(G\\) is in a right coset of \\(H\\). Finally deduce that the order of \\(H\\) divides the order of \\(G\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution R.2\n\n\n\n\nSolution R.2\n\n\nSince \\(H\\) is finite (say with order \\(m\\)) we may write \\(Hg=\\{h_1g, h_2g,\\ldots, h_mg\\}\\). It looks as if this set has size \\(m\\) (as it contains \\(m\\) symbols) but remember that \\(\\{1,1,2\\}\\) is a set of size 2 not 3. So to show that \\(Hg\\) really does have size \\(m\\) we need to show that all the symbols represent distinct group elements. As is often the case with pure mathematics, once we have worked out what we need to do actually doing it is straightforward. \\[h_ig=h_jg\\imp h_i=h_j \\;\\text{(by cancellation) so }|Hg|=m=|H|.\\] To prove that two right cosets are either identical or disjoint we show that if they have an element in common then they are identical. Suppose \\(Hg_1\\cap Hg_2\\neq\\emptyset\\) and let \\(x\\in Hg_1\\cap Hg_2\\). Then \\(\\exists \\, h_1,h_2\\in H\\) such that \\(h_1g_1=x\\) and \\(h_2g_2=x\\). It follows that \\(g_1=h_1^{-1}h_2g_2\\) (we will use this later). Let \\(z\\) be any element of \\(Hg_1\\). We will show that \\(z\\in Hg_2\\), from which it will follow that \\(Hg_1\\subseteq Hg_2\\). Let’s pause to think how we can do this - the fact that \\(z\\in Hg_1\\) means that \\(z\\) can be written as an element of \\(H\\) times \\(g_1\\). To show that \\(z\\in Hg_2\\) we need to write \\(z\\) as an element of \\(H\\) times \\(g_2\\). We will use the facts that \\(g_1=h_1^{-1}h_2g_2\\) and that \\(H\\) is a subgroup so any product of elements of \\(H\\) is another element of \\(H\\). Here goes… \\(z\\in Hg_1\\), so \\(\\exists h\\in H\\) such that \\(z=hg_1\\). But \\(g_1=h_1^{-1}h_2g_2\\), so \\(z=(hh_1^{-1}h_2)g_2\\in Hg_2\\), because \\(hh_1^{-1}h_2\\in H\\). So \\(Hg_1\\subseteq Hg_2\\) and a similar argument shows that \\(Hg_2\\subseteq Hg_1\\). It follows that \\(Hg_1=Hg_2\\) as required. Finally we show that every element is in a right coset. This is the easiest part of all because \\(H\\) contains the identity element \\(e\\in G\\) so \\(\\forall \\, g\\in G,\\\neg=g\\) and hence \\(g\\in Hg\\). Putting these facts together we have that the right cosets of \\(H\\) partition the elements of \\(G\\) into disjoint subsets which are all the same size as \\(H\\). It follows that the number of elements in \\(G\\) must be a multiple of the number of elements in \\(H\\) (where this multiple is the number of right cosets). In other words the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group (Lagrange’s Theorem).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion R.3\n\n\nLet \\(G\\) be a group and \\(H\\) the subset of \\(G\\) consisting of the identity \\(e\\) and all elements of \\(G\\) of order 2, so \\(H=\\{h\\in G| h^2=e\\}\\). Show that:\n\nif \\(G\\) is abelian, then \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\),\nif \\(G\\) is non-abelian, then \\(H\\) is not necessarily a subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution R.3\n\n\n\n\nSolution R.3\n\n\nHere we are being asked to prove that something is true for abelian groups but false for non-abelian ones. The first thing to do is make sure we know what the statement is! Let’s look at \\(G=\\Z_4\\), we have \\(0+0=0, 1+1=2, 2+2=0\\) and \\(3+3=2\\), so \\(H=\\{0,2\\}\\) and sure enough this forms a subgroup of \\(\\Z_4\\). Now let’s look at \\(D_3\\), using the Cayley table for \\(D_3\\) in the list of Cayley tables just after Example 1.2 we have \\(H=\\{0,3,4,5\\}\\). This is clearly not a subgroup of \\(D_3\\), for one thing \\(4\\) does not divide \\(6\\) (which would upset Lagrange) or, if you prefer, \\(3*4=1\\) so \\(H\\) is not closed. It’s important to use examples in this way even though we cannot use examples to prove statement i.; they are important in helping us understand what the statement means. Notice that we have answered part ii.! For this we only require a single counter-example and we’ve found one in \\(D_3\\).\nLet’s try to prove i.. We need one of our subgroup checking lemmas. Because we are not told that \\(G\\) is finite we need to use Lemma 2.6 from the Abstract Algebra module. Firstly, since \\(e^2=e\\) we have \\(e\\in H\\) so \\(H\\) is non-empty. We now need to show that \\(H\\) is closed, that is if \\(h_1,h_2\\in H\\) then \\(h_1*h_2\\in H\\). If \\(h_1,h_2\\in H\\), then \\(h_1^2=h_2^2=e\\) (and we need to show that \\((h_1h_2)^2=e\\)). Once we know what we are trying to show, and what we must use, we can write this concisely as follows. \\(h_1,h_2\\in H\\ \\imp (h_1h_2)^2=h_1h_2h_1h_2=h_1^2h_2^2=e*e=e\\) so \\(h_1h_2\\in H\\) as required. If \\(H\\) were finite then we would be done but because \\(H\\) may be infinite we need to show that the inverse of every element in \\(H\\) is also in \\(H\\). This is easy once we notice that \\(h^2=e\\imp h^{-1}=h\\). So the inverse of every element in \\(H\\) is also in \\(H\\)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion R.4\n\n\nShow that if \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) are subgroups of an abelian group \\(G\\), then \\[HK = \\{ hk \\, | \\, h \\in H, k \\in K \\}\\] is a subgroup of \\(G\\). Is this true for non-abelian groups?\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution R.4\n\n\n\n\nSolution R.4\n\n\nAgain, we do not know whether \\(HK\\) is a finite or infinite set, so we need to prove closure and then show that every element in the set also has its inverse in the set. In addition, it is obvious that both \\(H\\) and\\(K\\), and hence \\(HK\\), are non-empty. As usual, to prove closure we take two ‘typical’ elements of our subset and demonstrate that when they are combined under the binary operation of the group the resulting product remains in the subset. In order to do this it is important to know how membership of the subset is defined. Here we know that every element of \\(HK\\) is of the form \\(hk\\), where \\(h \\in H\\) and \\(k \\in K\\). It therefore follows that if \\(a \\in HK\\) there must be an \\(h \\in H\\) and a \\(k \\in K\\) such that \\(a = hk\\). Note, also, that as the group is abelian \\(hk = kh\\). We then proceed as follows:\nLet \\(a, b \\in HK\\), so \\(\\exists \\, h_1, h_2 \\in H\\) and \\(\\exists \\, k_1, k_2 \\in K\\) such that \\(a = h_1k_1\\) and \\(b = h_2k_2\\). Then, \\[ab = h_1k_1h_2k_2 = h_1h_2k_1k_2  \\in HK\\] since \\[h_1h_2 \\in H, k_1k_2 \\in K.\\] Note that the second step is valid since the group is abelian and the final step is valid since \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) are both groups so must be closed. To show that the subset \\(HK\\) is closed under inverses we need to remember an important property of inverses, namely that \\((xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}\\). Now, \\[a^{-1} = (h_1k_1)^{-1} = k_1^{-1}h_1^{-1} = h_1^{-1}k_1^{-1} \\in HK\\] since \\[h^{-1} \\in H, k^{-1} \\in K.\\] Note, again, that the second step is valid since the group is abelian and the final step is valid since \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) are both groups so must be closed under inverses. This statement is not true for non-abelian groups. For example \\(H = \\{e, s_1\\}\\) and \\(K = \\{e, s_2\\}\\) are subgroups of \\(D_3\\), but \\(HK =  \\{e, s_1, s_2, r_1\\}\\) is not a subgroup of \\(D_3\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion R.5\n\n\nLet \\((G_1, \\times)\\) and \\((G_2, \\circ)\\) be groups and \\(\\theta \\, : \\, G_1 \\rightarrow G_2\\) an isomorphism. Prove that \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G_1\\) if and only if \\(\\theta (H) = \\{\\theta(h) \\, | \\, h \\in H \\}\\) is a subgroup of \\(G_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution R.5\n\n\n\n\nSolution R.5\n\n\nThe usual procedures and caveats for proving ‘subgroupness’ apply here. It is also important to note that different binary operations are at work, depending on the group, and that this is an ‘if and only if’ statement so both forward and backward implications need to be considered. It should also be obvious that we will need to use the definition of an isomorphism, that is a bijective mapping from \\(G_1\\) to \\(G_2\\) such that for all \\(a, b \\in G_1\\), \\(\\theta(a \\times b) = \\theta(a) \\circ \\theta(b)\\). Taking the forward implication first, the proof then proceeds as follows (bearing in mind that we are trying to show that \\(\\theta (H)\\) is a subgroup of \\(G_2\\)):\nLet \\(H\\) be a subgroup of \\(G_1\\). Clearly both \\(H\\) and \\(\\theta(H)\\) are non-empty. Let \\(h_1^{\\prime}, h_2^{\\prime}\\) be any two elements of \\(\\theta H\\). Then \\(\\exists \\, h_1, h_2 \\in H\\) such that \\(\\theta (h_1) = h_1^{\\prime}\\) and \\(\\theta (h_2) = h_2^{\\prime}\\). Hence \\[h_1^{\\prime} \\circ h_2^{\\prime} = \\theta (h_1) \\circ \\theta (h_2) = \\theta (h_1 \\times h_2) \\in \\theta(H)\\] since \\[h_1 \\times h_2 \\in H.\\] The second step above uses the definition of an isomorphism and the last step is justified since we know that \\(H\\) is a group and therefore closed.\nNow, for all \\(h^{\\prime} \\in \\theta(H)\\) there exists \\(h \\in H\\) such that \\(\\theta (h) = h^{\\prime}\\). But \\[(h^{\\prime})^{-1} = (\\theta (h))^{-1} = \\theta(h^{-1}) \\in \\theta(H)\\] since \\[h^{-1} \\in H.\\]\nFor the backward implication (converse), that is if \\(\\theta(H)\\) is a subgroup of \\(G_2\\) then \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G_1\\), we either construct a similar argument to that above or (much better) use the fact that \\(\\theta^{-1} :  G_2 \\rightarrow G_1\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G_2\\) to \\(G_1\\) and so the result follows immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion R.6\n\n\nShow that if \\(G\\) is an abelian group then \\[\\{ g^2 \\, | \\, g \\in G \\}\\] is a subgroup of \\(G\\), but this is not true for groups in general.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution R.6\n\n\n\n\nSolution R.6\n\n\nYou should be used to the process by now! Let \\(H = \\{ g^2 \\, | \\, g \\in G \\}\\). Clearly \\(H\\) is non-empty by definition. Let \\(a, b \\in H\\). Then there exist \\(g_1, g_2 \\in G\\) such that \\(a = g_1^2\\) and \\(b = g_2^2\\). Then, \\[ab = g_1^2g_2^2 = g_1g_1g_2g_2 = g_1g_2g_1g_2 = (g_1g_2)^2 \\in H\\] since \\[g_1g_2 \\in G.\\] Further, \\[a^{-1} = (g_1^2)^{-1} = g_1^{-2} = (g_1^{-1})^2 \\in H\\] since \\[g_1^{-1} \\in G.\\] Hence, \\(H = \\{ g^2 \\, | \\, g \\in G \\}\\) is a subgroup of G.\nTo show that this is not the case for groups in general we need to find a non-abelian group to give us a counter example, but this isn’t obvious. We would usually look to the dihedral groups to provide such a counter example, but, in fact, the given statement is true for \\(D_n\\) for all \\(n\\). (Can you see why? If not, ask!). In fact we need to go to \\(A_4\\), a group of order 12, to find the first counter example. Why this group provides a counter example will become clearer once we have completed the chapter on permutations, but the reason is as follows. \\(A_4\\) consists of the identity, 8 permutations of the form \\((* \\; * \\; *)\\) and 3 permutations of the form \\((* \\; *)(* \\; *)\\) (12 elements in total). Since squaring the identity or the permutations of the form \\((* \\; *)(* \\; *)\\) gives the identity and squaring the 3-cycles just gives the 3-cycles (all eight of them), then the subset \\(H = \\{ g^2 \\, | \\, g \\in A_4 \\}\\) contains nine elements. This cannot form a subgroup of \\(A_4\\) as that would violate Lagrange’s Theorem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion R.7\n\n\nWe know that every proper subgroup of a cyclic group is itself cyclic. State the converse and give a counter example to demonstrate that the converse is false.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution R.7\n\n\n\n\nSolution R.7\n\n\nThe converse of the statement is “If a group \\(G\\) is such that every proper subgroup is cyclic, then \\(G\\) is cyclic”. This statement is false since any non-cyclic group of order \\(pq\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are prime (e.g \\(D_{pq}\\)) has only proper subgroups of prime order which are necessarily cyclic (as is \\(\\{e \\}\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion R.8\n\n\nIn each of the following cases, find the order of the given element in the direct product:\n\n\\((3, 7)\\) in \\(\\Z_9 \\times \\Z_{14}\\);\n\\((8, 11)\\) in \\(\\Z_{10} \\times \\Z_{15}\\);\n\\((3, 7, 12)\\) in \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_{10} \\times \\Z_{15}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution R.8\n\n\n\n\nSolution R.8\n\n\nFirst, recall that to find the order of \\((a, b)\\) in \\(G_1 \\times G_2\\), where \\(a \\in G_1\\) and \\(b \\in G_2\\), we take the lowest common multiple of the orders of \\(a\\) in \\(G_1\\) and \\(b\\) in \\(G_2\\). Remember, also, that an element \\(a\\) in \\(\\Z_m\\) has order equal to \\(m/\\gcd(a, m)\\).\n\n\\((3, 7)\\) in \\(\\Z_9 \\times \\Z_{14}\\). Obviously 3 has order 3 in \\(\\Z_9\\) and 7 has order 2 in \\(\\Z_{14}\\). So the order of \\((3, 7)\\) in \\(\\Z_9 \\times \\Z_{14}\\) is lcm\\((3, 2) = 6\\).\n\\((8, 11)\\) in \\(\\Z_{10} \\times \\Z_{15}\\): The order of 8 in \\(\\Z_{10}\\) is 10/gcd\\((8, 10) = 5\\). Similarly the order of 11 in \\(\\Z_{15} = 15\\). So, the order of \\((8, 11)\\) in \\(\\Z_{10} \\times \\Z_{15}\\) is lcm\\((5, 15) = 15\\).\n\\((3, 7, 12)\\) in \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_{10} \\times \\Z_{15}\\). The order of 3 in \\(\\Z_4\\) is 4/gcd(3, 4) = 4. Similarly the order of 7 in \\(\\Z_{10} = 10\\), and the order of 12 in \\(\\Z_{15} = 5\\). So, the order of \\((3, 7, 12)\\) in \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_{10} \\times \\Z_{15}\\) is lcm\\((4, 10, 5) = 20\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion R.9\n\n\n\nWrite down all of the generators of\n\n\\(\\Z_{14}\\),\n\\(\\Z_{15}\\).\n\nClassify, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, all of the abelian groups of orders\n\n54,\n\n\n\n\nIn part ii.a. above, state which of the groups of order 54 is cyclic and which is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_6 \\times \\Z_9\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution R.9\n\n\n\n\nSolution R.9\n\n\n\nRecall that the generators of \\(\\Z_m\\) are those elements that are relatively prime to \\(m\\). So the generators of \\(\\Z_{14}\\) are 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13 and the generators of \\(\\Z_{15}\\) are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14.\nWe state, first, the Theorem: &gt;Every finitely abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of the form \\[\\Z_{p_1^{r_1}}\\times\\Z_{p_2^{r_2}}\\times \\cdots \\times \\Z_{p_n^{r_n}}\\] where the \\(p_i\\) are primes, not necessarily distinct (and \\(r\\) may be 0).\n\nNow, \\(54 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3\\), which is its prime decomposition. Hence the possible groups, in accordance with the theorem, are \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_{27}\\), \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_9\\), and \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_3\\).\n\\(600 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5^2\\). So the isomorphically distinct groups are \\(\\Z_8 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_{25}\\), \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_{25}\\), \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2  \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_{25}\\), \\(\\Z_8 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_5 \\times \\Z_5\\), \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_5 \\times \\Z_5\\), and \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_5 \\times \\Z_5\\).\n\nRemember that \\(\\Z_r\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_m \\times \\Z_n\\) if and only if \\(r = mn\\) and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime. So, for example, \\(\\Z_{12}\\) is not isomorphic to \\(\\Z_6 \\times \\Z_2\\) as 6 and 2 are not relatively prime. If we are dealing with a direct product of more than two cyclic groups then the same principle applies except that the orders have to be pairwise relatively prime. Now we know that \\(\\Z_n\\) is cyclic for all \\(n\\), so \\(\\Z_{54}\\) must be cyclic. This is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_{27}\\) since 2 and 27 are relatively prime, so \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_{27}\\) must be cyclic. The group that is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_6 \\times \\Z_9\\) is \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z_9\\), since \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3 \\cong \\Z_6\\) as 2 and 3 are relatively prime.",

    "text": "1.8 Problem Sheet 1\nFor the example class in Week 3; covers Chapter 1 material. At minimum you should attempt questions 1.4, 1.5 and 1.7.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1.1\n\n\nLet \\(R\\) be a relation on a non-empty set, \\(S\\)\n\nDefine a relation on \\(\\Z^+\\) by, for \\(x, y \\in \\Z^+\\), \\(xRy\\) if and only if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have the same number of digits in the usual base 10 notation. Show that this is an equivalence relation.\nFind the equivalence class containing \\(37\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 1.1\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.1\n\n\nRecall that, for a relation to be an equivalence relation, we require that it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. These terms are defined as follows: A relation, \\(R\\), on a non-empty set \\(S\\) is said to be\n\nreflexive: if \\(aRa\\) for all \\(a \\in S\\),\nsymmetric: if, whenever \\(aRb\\), then \\(bRa\\),\ntransitive if, whenever \\(aRb\\) and \\(bRc\\), then \\(aRc\\).\n\nApplying the definitions to our relation:\n\ntrivial, since an integer has the same number of digits as itself so \\(xRx\\);\nagain, it is obvious that if \\(x\\) has the same number of digits as \\(y\\) then \\(y\\) has the same number of digits as \\(x\\), so if \\(xRy\\) then \\(yRx\\);\nit is clear that if \\(w \\in \\Z^+\\) and \\(xRw\\) and \\(wRy\\), then \\(xRy\\).\n\nThus \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on the set \\(S\\). Obviously, all of the members of any given equivalence class must have the same number of digits. thus the class containing 37 will be \\([37] = \\{10, 11, \\; \\ldots, 37, \\ldots \\; , 99 \\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1.2\n\n\nDefine a relation on \\(\\R\\) by, for \\(a, b \\in \\R\\), \\(aRb\\) if and only if \\(| \\, a \\, | = | \\, b \\, |\\). Is this an equivalence relation? If so, how does it partition the set?\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 1.2\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.2\n\n\nApplying the definitions to our relation:\n\n\\(a R a\\) since, \\(\\forall a \\in \\R, \\; |a| = |a|\\).\nIf \\(a R b\\) then, by definition, \\(|a| = |b|\\). It then follows, since \\(|b| = |a|\\), that \\(b R a\\).\nWe know, for any real numbers \\(x, y, z\\) that if \\(x = y\\) and \\(y = z\\), then \\(x=z\\). Now, if \\(a R b\\) and \\(b R c\\) then \\(|a| = |b|\\) and \\(|b| = |c|\\) and hence it follows that \\(|a| = |c|\\) and so \\(a R c\\).\n\nThus \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on the real numbers. The relation partitions \\(\\R\\) as follows: \\[[0] = \\{ 0 \\} \\qquad \\qquad [a] = \\{ a, -a \\} \\quad \\forall a \\in \\R.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1.3\n\n\nDefine a relation that partitions the plane into the origin and all circles centred at the origin with radius \\(r \\in \\R\\). Prove that this is an equivalence relation.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 1.3\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.3\n\n\nRecall that a circle centred at the origin is the set of all points of the plane that are at a given distance from the origin. In Cartesian coordinates, a point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) has distance \\(\\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}\\) from the origin. It follows that if a point \\((x_2, y_2)\\) lies on the same circle then \\(\\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}.\\) Since distances are always positive we thus have that \\(x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_2^2 + y_2^2\\). This allows us to define the relation that partitions the plane as described: \\[(x_1, y_1) R (x_2, y_2) \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_2^2 + y_2^2.\\] We now need to show that this is an equivalence relation.\n\nClearly \\(x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_1^2 + y_1^2\\), hence \\((x_1, y_1) R (x_1, y_1)\\) and so the relation is reflexive.\nEqually clearly, if \\(x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_2^2 + y_2^2\\) then \\(x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + y_1^2\\), hence if \\((x_1, y_1) R (x_2, y_2)\\), then \\((x_2, y_2) R (x_1, y_1)\\), so the relation is symmetric.\nIf \\((x_1, y_1)  R  (x_2, y_2)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2) R  (x_3, y_3)\\) then it follows that \\(x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_2^2 + y_2^2\\) and \\(x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_3^2 + y_3^2\\). Hence, \\(x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_3^2 + y_3^2\\) and so \\((x_1, y_1) R  (x_3, y_3)\\), demonstrating that the relation is transitive.\n\nThus we have demonstrated that the relation, as defined, is an equivalence relation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1.4\n\n\nIn the group \\[\\langle A, B, C\\, |\\, A^7=B^3=C^2=1, BA=A^3B, CA=AC, CB=B^2C\\rangle\\] express each of the following in the form \\(A^rB^sC^t\\):\n\n\\((BC)^2\\);\n\\(B^2A^3\\);\n\\(C^3B^{-2}\\);\n\\((AB)^3\\);\n\\((ABC)^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 1.4\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.4\n\n\n\nHere we use the fourth condition, namely \\(CB = B^2C\\), so \\[(BC)^2 = BCBC = B(CB)C = B(B^2C)C = B^3C^2.\\]\nFirst, we repeatedly apply the second condition, \\(BA = A^3B\\), that is \\[\\begin{align*}\nB^2A^3 &= B(BA)AA = B(A^3B)AA = BA^3(BA)A\\\\\n&= BA^3(A^3B)A = BA^6(BA) = BA^9B\n\\end{align*}\\] and then we use \\(A^7 = 1\\) so \\[BA^9B = BA^2B = (BA)AB = A^3(BA)B = A^3(A^3B)B = A^6B^2.\\]\nFirst use the fact that \\(C^2 = 1\\), so \\(C^3B^{-2} = CB^{-2}\\). Now, \\(B^3 = 1\\), so \\(BB^2 = 1\\) and hence \\(B^2 = B^{-1}\\) or \\(B^{-2} = B\\). Then, \\[C^3B^{-2} = CB^{-2} = CB = B^2C.\\]\n\\((AB)^3 = ABABAB = A(BA)(BA)B\\). We now use \\(BA = A^3B\\) on each of the bracketed expressions, \\[A(BA)(BA)B = A(A^3B)(A^3B)B = A^4BA^3B^2.\\] Now we use the same relation three times to ‘hop’ the \\(A\\) over the \\(B\\) as follows \\[A^4BA^3B^2 = A^4(BA^3)B^2 = A^4(A^9B)B^2 = A^{13}B^3 = A^6\\] as \\(A^7 = 1\\) and \\(B^3 = 1\\).\nNote that \\(A^7 = 1  \\imp A^6 = A^{-1}\\); \\(B^3 = 1 \\imp B^2 = B^{-1}\\); \\(C^2 = 1 \\imp C = C^{-1}\\). So \\((ABC)^{-1} = C^{-1}B^{-1}A^{-1} = CB^2A^6\\). Now use the relation \\(CB = B^2C\\) twice to ‘hop’ the \\(B\\) over to the front of the \\(C\\), that is \\(CB^2A^6 = B^4CA^6 = BCA^6\\) since \\(B^3 = 1\\). Next use \\(CA = AC\\) six times to ‘hop’ the \\(A\\) over the \\(C\\), \\[BCA^6 = BA^6C.\\] Finally we use \\(BA = A^3B\\) six times to ‘hop’ the \\(A\\) over the \\(B\\), that is \\[BA^6C = A^{18}BC = A^4BC\\] since \\(A^7 = 1.\\) And so we have that \\((ABC)^{-1} = A^4BC\\). You may, however, have approached this problem from a different angle. Suppose we start by ‘hopping’ the \\(A\\) over the \\(B\\). We can do this in two steps using \\(BA = A^3B\\) as follows: \\[CB^2A^6 = CBBA^6 = CBA^{18}B = CBA^4B\\] as \\(A^7 = 1\\). We now repeat that step four more times \\[CBA^4B = CA^{12}BB = CA^5B^2\\] since \\(A^7 = 1\\). Now apply \\(CA = AC\\) five times to ‘hop’ the \\(A\\) over the \\(C\\) as follows \\(CA^5B^2 = A^5CB^2\\). Finally, we use \\(CB = B^2C\\) to obtain \\[A^5CB^2= A^5B^4C = A^5BC\\] since \\(B^3 = 1\\). And so we have that \\((ABC)^{-1} = A^5BC\\). What has gone wrong? Well, actually, nothing at all has gone wrong! Both answers are perfectly valid. So what is going on?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1.5\n\n\nLet \\(G = \\langle a, b, c \\, | \\, a^4 = b^3 = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, bc = cb \\rangle\\). Classify \\(G\\) according to the Fundamental Theorem.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 1.5\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.5\n\n\nNote that the generators commute with each other pairwise, so we know that the group is abelian. So every product can be reduced to the form \\(a^ib^jc^k\\) where \\(0 \\leq i &lt; 4\\), \\(0 \\leq j &lt; 3\\) and \\(k \\in \\Z\\) (no constraint on \\(k\\)). Hence, the group is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_3 \\times \\Z\\) with the isomorphism given by \\(a^ib^jc^k \\mapsto (i, j, k)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1.6\n\n\nIf \\(G=\\langle a,b\\, | \\, ab=ba, a^4=b^3=1 \\rangle\\) and \\(H\\) is the cyclic subgroup generated by \\(b\\), classify \\(G\\) according to the Fundamental Theorem, and find the left and right cosets of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 1.6\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.6\n\n\nIt should be obvious that \\(G \\cong \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_3\\). Note that this group is abelian and so the distinct right and left cosets will coincide. We have: \\[\\begin{align*}\nH &= \\{0, b, 2b\\}\\\\\na+H &= H+a = \\{a, a+b, a+2b\\}\\\\\n2a+H &= H+2a = \\{2a, 2a+b, 2a+2b\\}\\\\\n3a+H &= H+3a = \\{3a, 3a+b, 3a+2b\\}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1.7\n\n\nIn the dihedral group \\(D_5=\\langle a, b\\, | \\, a^5=1, b^2=1, ab=ba^{-1} \\rangle\\), simplify:\n\n\\(a^7b^3a^{-2}baba^3ba^2a^7b^2a\\);\n\\(a^{13}b^5a^2b^{-7}a^2ba\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 1.7\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.7\n\n\n\nFirst, using \\(a^5 = 1\\) and \\(b^2 = 1\\) we have \\[a^7b^3a^{-2}baba^3ba^2a^7b^2a = a^2ba^3baba^3ba^4b^2a.\\] Now bracket together all the terms \\(ba\\) and then use \\(ab = ba^{-1} \\imp ba = aba^2\\). Hence \\[\\begin{align*}\n&a^2ba^3baba^3ba^4b^2a\\\\\n&= a^2(ba)a^2(ba)(ba)a^2(ba)a^3b^2a\\\\\n&= a^2(aba^2)a^2(aba^2)(aba^2)a^2(aba^2)a^4\\\\\n&= a^3ba^5ba^3ba^5ba^6\\\\\n&= a^3b^2a^3b^2a\\\\\n&= a^7\\\\\n&= a^2.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNote that, \\(a^5 = 1\\) and as \\(b^2 = 1\\), then \\(b=b^{-1}\\) and so \\(b^n = b^{-n}\\). Then \\[\\begin{align*}\n&a^{13}b^5a^2b^{-7}a^2ba\\\\\n&= a^3ba^2ba^2ba\\\\\n&= a^2(ab)a(ab)a(ab)a\\\\\n&= a^2(ba^{-1})a(ba^{-1})a(ba^{-1})a\\\\\n&= a^2bbb\\\\\n&= a^2b.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1.8\n\n\nIn \\((\\Q,+)\\), describe the elements of \\(\\langle \\frac{1}{2} \\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle \\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3} \\rangle\\).

For \\(\\langle \\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3} \\rangle\\) we now have two generators, so the subgroup consists of all sums of multiples of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). Hence \\(\\langle \\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3} \\rangle=\\{\\frac{m}{2}+\\frac{n}{3} \\, | \\, m,n\\in\\Z\\}=\\{\\frac{n}{6} \\, | \\, n\\in\\Z\\}\\). The final equality follows because gcd(2,3)=1 and hence every integer can be expressed in the form \\(3m+2n\\) (why?). Given a finite set \\(S\\) in \\((\\Q,+)\\), \\(\\langle S \\rangle\\) will only contain rationals which can be expressed with denominator equal to the lowest common multiple of the denominators of the elements of \\(S\\). So any fraction whose denominator is not of this form is not in \\(\\langle S \\rangle\\) and hence \\(\\Q\\) has no finite generating set. For an explicit example take a prime \\(p\\) greater than all the denominators in \\(S\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{p}\\notin \\langle S \\rangle\\).",

    "text": "2.1 Cayley’s Theorem\nCayley’s Theorem tells us that every finite group is isomorphic to some group of permutations. One way of seeing this is to simply read off the rows of the Cayley table for a group as permutations of the elements themselves.\nWe say that we have represented the group as a group of permutations. Notice that we can represent each of the group elements by the permutation of the column border defined by its row. Consider the group element 2 above. If we pre-multiply by 2 each of the elements of the group in their column border order, then we get the elements re-ordered as in row 2. That is, \\[\\begin{equation*}\n2 \\mapsto \\begin{pmatrix}\n0&1&2&3&4&5\\\\\n2&0&1&5&3&4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nOf course, the elements of the group do not have to be numbers.\nIn both of the above examples, and in general, we replace \\(g \\in G = \\{g_1, g_2, \\ldots, g_n\\}\\) by the permutation \\[\\begin{pmatrix}\ng_1&g_2&\\ldots&g_n\\\\\ngg_1&gg_2&\\ldots&gg_n\n\\end{pmatrix}\\] This is called the left regular representation of \\(g\\) and is denoted \\(\\lambda_g\\). So, we have that \\(\\lambda_g(x) = gx, \\; \\forall x \\in G\\). It is important to note, at this point, that when we say that every finite group is isomorphic to a group of permutations we do not necessarily mean the full symmetry group itself; it is more likely to be a subgroup of the full symmetry group (for example, \\(D_4\\) has order 8 but there is no \\(S_n\\) with order 8 for any \\(n\\) and so \\(D_4\\) will be isomorphic to some subgroup of \\(S_4\\) of order 8).\nNotice what we did in that proof. First, we demonstrated that for each \\(a \\in G\\) then \\(\\lambda_a\\) is indeed a permutation and we did that by showing that \\(\\lambda_a\\) is a bijective function from \\(G\\) to itself (because the set is finite it is sufficient to show injectivity). Second, we took the set of all \\(\\lambda_a\\), for a given \\(a \\in G\\), and demonstrated that this set forms a subgroup of \\(S_n\\) (as the set is finite we need only show closure). Third, we defined a function, \\(\\theta\\), mapping from our group \\(G\\) to the subgroup of \\(S_n\\) (which we denoted \\(\\gp\\)), and proved that was an isomorphism in the usual way. A reasonable question to ask at this point is why study abstract groups at all? If every finite group is isomorphic to some group of permutations then why not just study permutation groups? Well, often we do study groups via permutations, but any given finite group can be represented by permutation groups in infinitely many different ways and it is not always obvious which way is the most convenient or appropriate. For example, notice that the group in Example 2.2 is, in fact, isomorphic to \\(S_3\\), the symmetric group of order 6, and yet the proof of Cayley’s Theorem represents the group as a subgroup of \\(S_6\\). Secondly there are lots of other ways of representing groups and some ways are better than others depending on what we are trying to do or find out. The permutations above have been written in two row notation. We will usually adopt cycle notation and because permutations are functions, and multiplication of permutations is function composition, we will compose (or multiply) permutations from right to left (as you did in the Abstract Algebra module).",

Notice that \\(\\lambda_{a}\\) is a permutation of \\(G\\) since it has an inverse \\(\\lambda_{a^{-1}}\\).\nSet \\(G' = \\{\\lambda_{a} \\mid a \\in G\\}\\). Then \\(G'\\) is a subgroup of the group of permutations of \\(G\\). This follows as for \\(a,b \\in G\\): \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\lambda_{a}\\circ\\lambda(b)(x) &= \\lambda_a(bx) \\\\\n                                  &= abx \\\\\n                                  &= \\lambda_{ab}(x)\n  \\end{align*}\\] for all \\(x \\in G\\). Therefore \\(\\lambda_a \\circ \\lambda_{b} = \\lambda_{ab} \\in G\\). Further observe that \\(|G'| = |G|\\). This is because for \\(a,b \\in G\\) with \\(a \\ne b\\), \\(\\lambda_{a} \\ne \\lambda_{b}\\). For instance \\(\\lambda_{a}(e) = a \\ne b = \\lambda_{b}(e)\\).\nLet \\(\\theta: G \\to G'\\) be the map defined by \\(\\theta(a) = \\lambda_a\\) for all \\(a \\in G\\). Then \\(\\theta\\) is a bijection. Thus, to see that \\(\\theta\\) is an isomorphism, we only need show that it is a homomorphism. Let \\(a, b \\in G\\), \\[\\theta(ab) = \\lambda_{ab} = \\lambda_{a}\\circ \\lambda_{b} = \\theta(a) \\circ \\theta_{b}.\\] Therefore \\(\\theta\\) is a homomorphism and so an isomorphism.\nLastly observe that the group of permutations of \\(G\\) is isomorphic to \\(S_{|G|}\\). We conclude that \\(G\\) is therefore isomorphic to a subgroup of \\(S_{|G|}\\).\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.4  \n\nReturning to Example 2.2 once more.

    "text": "2.2 Cycle Structure\nRecall that the symmetric group of degree \\(n\\) is the set of all permutations of \\(n\\) things (usually the numbers from 1 up to \\(n\\)). The group is denoted \\(S_n\\) and since there are \\(n!\\) ways to permute or order \\(n\\) objects, then we have that \\(|S| = n!\\). The cycle structure of a permutation is its structure as a collection of disjoint cycles which can be described by replacing each of the symbols with a \\(*\\). For example, the cycle structure of \\((1 \\; 2)(3 \\; 4 \\; 5)(6 \\; 7)\\) is \\((* \\; *)(* \\; * \\; *)(* \\; *)\\), which we can also write as \\((* \\;*)(* \\; *)(* \\; * \\; *)\\) or even \\((* \\; *)^2(* \\; * \\; *)\\), remembering that disjoint cycles commute. Permutations with the same cycle structure have similar properties, for example they have the same order because the order of any permutation is the lowest common multiple of the lengths of its disjoint cycles.\n\nExample 2.5  \n\nThe possible cycle structures in \\(S_3\\) are: \\[I, (\\ast \\; \\ast), (\\ast \\; \\ast \\; \\ast).\\]\nFor a \\(2\\)-cycle, there are \\(3\\) choices for the first element and then \\(2\\) for the second giving a total of six \\(2\\)-cycles:\n\\[ (1 \\; 2), (1 \\; 3), (2 \\; 1), (2 \\; 3), (3 \\; 1) (3 \\; 2). \\]\nHowever, a the cycles \\((a \\; b)\\) is the same as the cycle \\((b \\; a)\\). Therefore, we have a total of \\(3\\) distinct \\(2\\)-cycles: \\[ (1 \\; 2), (1 \\; 3),  (2 \\; 3). \\]\nIn a similar way there are \\(3!/3 = 2\\) distinct \\(3\\)-cycles. Since the total number of \\(3\\)-cycles is \\(3!\\), we divide by \\(3\\) to get the number of distinct cycles since we have the equalities \\[(a \\; b \\; c) = (b \\; c \\; a) = (c \\; a \\; b)\\] for a cycle \\((a \\; b \\;  c)\\).\nSo \\[S_3 = \\{I, (1 \\; 2), (1 \\; 3),  (2 \\; 3), (1 \\; 2 \\; 3), (1\\; 3 \\; 2) \\}.\\]\nNote that \\(|S_3| = 3! = 6\\).\nFor \\(S_4\\) we haven:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n\\text{Structure} & \\text{number} \\\\\n\\hline\nI & 1 \\\\\n(\\ast \\; \\ast) & 6 = \\frac{4\\times 3}{2} \\\\\n(\\ast \\; \\ast \\; \\ast) & 8 = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2}{3} \\\\\n(\\ast \\; \\ast \\; \\ast \\; \\ast) & 6 = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2}{4} \\\\\n(\\ast \\; \\ast) (\\ast \\; \\ast) & 3 = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2}{2 \\times 2 \\times 2} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\] Notice that \\[|S_4| = 1 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 3 = 24 = 4!.\\]",

    "text": "2.3 Conjugates\nWe begin with a definition.\n\nDefinition 2.1 (Conjugate) If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are permutations (defined on the same set) then the conjugate of \\(a\\) by \\(b\\) is the permutation \\(bab^{-1}\\).\n\nLater we shall extend the definition of conjugacy, in the obvious way, to group elements in general but for now we concentrate on permutations and hopefully get some idea as to why conjugacy is such a useful concept.\n\nExample 2.6  \n\nLet \\(a = (1 \\; 2 \\; 3)(4 \\; 5), b = (1 \\; 6 \\; 2 \\; 4 \\; 3) \\in S_6\\). The the conjugate of \\(a\\) by \\(b\\) is: \\[\\begin{align}\nbab^{-1} &= (1 \\; 6 \\; 2 \\; 4 \\; 3) (1 \\; 2 \\; 3)(4 \\; 5) (1 \\; 3 \\; 4 \\; 2 \\; 6) \\\\\n&= (1 \\; 6 \\; 4)(3 \\; 5)\n\\end{align}\\]\nNote that \\(a\\) and \\(bab^{-1}\\) have the same cycle structure: \\[(\\ast \\; \\ast \\; \\ast)(\\ast \\; \\ast).\\]\nLess obvious is the fact that \\(bab^{-1}\\) can be obtained from \\(a\\) by replacing each element in each cycle of the disjoint cycle of a by its image under \\(b\\). That is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\na & = (1 \\; 2 \\; 3)(4 \\; 5) \\\\\nbab^{-1} &= (b(1) \\; b(2) \\; b(3))(b(4) \\; b(5)) \\\\\n&= (6 \\; 4 \\; 1)(3 \\; 5) \\\\\n&= (1 \\; 6 \\; 4)(3 \\; 5).\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe next theorem demonstrates that the above holds true in general.\n\n\n\nTheorem 2.2 The conjugate of \\(a = (x_1 \\; x_2 \\; \\ldots \\; x_r) (y_1 \\; y_2 \\; \\ldots \\; y_s) \\ldots (z_1 \\; z_2 \\; \\ldots \\; z_t)\\) by \\(b\\) is \\[c = (b(x_1) \\; b(x_2) \\; \\ldots \\; b(x_r)) (b(y_1) \\; b(y_2) \\; \\ldots \\; b(y_s)) \\ldots (b(z_1) \\; b(z_2) \\; \\ldots \\; b(z_t)),\\] where \\(a\\) has been expressed as a product of disjoint cycles.\n\n\nProof. \n\nIt suffices to show that \\(ba = cb\\) since, post-multiplying by \\(b\\), this implies that \\(bab^{-1} = c\\).\nLet \\(x\\) be an element not fixed by \\(a\\). Without loss of generality we may assume that \\(x= x_1\\). We then have: \\[\\begin{align*}\nba(x_1) &= b(x_2)\\\\\ncb(x_1) &= b(x_2)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIf \\(x\\) is fixed by \\(a\\) then: \\[\\begin{align*}\nba(x) &= b(x)\\\\\ncb(x) &= b(x)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nHence, \\(ba = cb\\) as required.\n\n\n\nDefinition 2.2 (Conjugacy) Let \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) be permutations (defined on the same set). Then \\(a\\) is conjugate to \\(c\\) means that there exists a permutation \\(b\\) such that \\(c = bab^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\nIf \\(c\\) is the conjugate of \\(a\\) by \\(b\\), then \\(a\\) is the conjugate of \\(c\\) by \\(b^{-1}\\). This can be seen as follows: \\[\\begin{align}\nc &= bab^{-1} \\\\\n\\iff b^{-1}c &= ab^{-1}\\\\\n\\iff b^{-1}cb &=a.\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis show that the relation \\(R\\) on a group \\(G\\) that relates two elements whenever they are conjugate to to one another is symmetric. One can show that this relation is reflexive and transitive and, consequently, is an equivalence relation.\n\n\n\nCorollary 2.1 Two permutations are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle structure.\n\n\nProof. \n\nThis follows from the proof of Theorem 2.2.\n\n\n\nExample 2.7  \n\nLet \\(a = (1 \\; 5 \\; 2 \\; 4 )(3 \\; 7)\\) and \\(c= (1 \\; 6)(2 \\; 4 \\; 3 \\; 5)\\) be elements of \\(S_7\\). Clearly \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) have the same cycle structure and so must be conjugate. We can find an element in \\(S_{7}\\) that conjugates \\(a\\) to \\(c\\) by finding an element \\(b\\) satisfying \\[\\begin{align}\n(b(1) \\; b(5) \\; b(2) \\; b(4)) &= (2 \\; 4 \\; 3 \\; 5)\\\\\n(b(3) \\; b(7)) &= (1 \\; 6 ).\n\\end{align}\\]\nFor example \\(b = (1 \\; 2 \\; 3) (4 \\; 5)(6 \\; 7)\\) works.",

    "text": "2.4 The 15-Puzzle\nThe original 15-puzzle is a tray with 15 numbered tiles that are free to slide into a single blank space but may not be removed from the tray. \\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline 5&6&7&8\\\\\n\\hline 9&10&11&12\\\\\n\\hline 13&14&15&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\] After jumbling the pieces thoroughly the object is to bring them back into the above solved state. This puzzle was marketed by the American puzzle maker Sam Loyd in the 1890s, the resulting craze was fuelled by Loyd’s offer of a $1,000 prize for anyone who could solve the puzzle starting from the state with 14 and 15 swapped. \\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline 5&6&7&8\\\\\n\\hline 9&10&11&12\\\\\n\\hline 13&15&14&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\] One way to model this problem is to treat the blank space as tile number 16. The solution requires us to express the transposition \\((14\\ 15)\\) as a product of transpositions each involving 16. Of course not all transpositions with 16 are allowed, for example our first move must be either \\((12\\ 16)\\) or \\((14\\ 16)\\) but each move results in tile 16 moving one space vertically or one space horizontally. Since tile 16 must end up in the same position it started we must have that the number of ‘’up’’ moves equals the number of ‘’down’’ moves and the number of ‘’left moves’’ equals the number of ‘’right moves’’. Hence the number of transpositions required for any solution is even but \\((14\\ 15)\\) is clearly an odd permutation so no solution is possible (and Sam Loyd’s money was safe). The above analysis, although powerful and elegant, only tells us half the story. If we rearrange the tiles so that the empty space ends up where it started, then only even permutations of the remaining blocks are possible. A similar argument shows that if the empty space is allowed to end up somewhere else, then if the space is an even (odd) distance from its starting point then only even (odd) permutations are possible. But are all such permutations possible? The answer is yes and it follows from the following results about the Alternating Group.\n\nLemma 2.1 For \\(n \\geq 3\\), \\(A_n\\) is generated by its 3-cycles.\n\n\nProof. \n\nFirst observe that \\(A_n\\) contains all \\(3\\) cycles and so the group generated by all \\(3\\) cycles is a subgroup of \\(A_{n}\\).\nLet \\(g \\in A_n\\) then there are transpositions \\(t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_{2_{k}}\\) such that \\(g = t_1 t_2 \\ldots t_{2k}\\). Write \\(g = (t_1 t_2) (t_3 t_4) \\ldots (t_{2k-1} t_{2k})\\). For each odd \\(i\\) in the set \\(\\{1,\\ldots, 2k\\}\\) there are three possibilities for \\(t_{i}t_{i+1}\\)\n\n\\(t_{i} = t_{i+1}\\): in this case \\(t_i t_{i+1} = I\\).\n\\(t_i\\) and \\(t_{i+1}\\) have a point in common.In this case there are \\(a,b,c\\) such that \\(t_i = (a \\; b)\\) and \\(t_{i+1} = (b \\; c)\\). Hence, \\(t_{i}t_{i+1} = (a \\; b \\; c)\\).\n\\(t_i\\) and \\(t_{i+1}\\) have no point in common. In this case there are \\(a,b,c,d\\) such that \\(t_i = (a \\; b)\\) and \\(t_{i+1} = (c \\; d)\\). Observe that the equality \\[t_i t_{i+1} = (a \\; b) (c \\; d) = (a \\; c \\; d)(a \\; b \\; d)\\] holds in this case.\n\nTherefore, whenever \\(t_it_{i+1}\\) is not trivial we may replace it with a 3-cycle or with a product of 3-cycles. We see that \\(g\\) can therefore be written as a product of 3-cycles. The result now follows.\n\n\nNote the structure of that proof. We were required to show that \\(A_n\\) is generated by its 3-cycles. Let us assume that \\(S\\) is the set of all 3-cycles where, obviously, \\(S\\) will depend on \\(n\\). In the first part of the proof we demonstrated that \\(S \\subseteq A_n\\) and in the second part that \\(A_n \\subseteq S\\). Hence we showed that the sets are equal and so the result follows.\n\nTheorem 2.3 For \\(n \\geq 3\\), \\(A_n\\) is generated by its 3-cycles of the form \\((1 \\; 2 \\; i)\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nIt suffices to show, by Lemma 2.1 that any 3-cycle can be written as a product of elements of the form \\((1 \\; 2 \\; i)\\) and their inverses.\nNow \\[\\begin{align*}\n(1 \\; a \\; 2) (1 \\; 2 \\; c) (1 \\; b \\; 2)(1 \\; 2 \\; a) &= (1 \\; 2 \\; a)^{-1} (1 \\; 2 \\; c) (1 \\; b \\; 2)(1 \\; 2 \\; a) \\\\\n&= (1 \\; 2 \\; a)^{-1} (1 \\; b \\; c) (1 \\; 2 \\; a) \\\\\n&= (a \\; b \\; c).\n\\end{align*}\\] This concludes the proof.\n\n\nClearly the same result would hold if 1 and 2 were replaced by any other distinct symbols. We want to know which starting positions, with the empty space in the bottom right hand corner, can be rearranged back into the solved state: \\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline 5&6&7&8\\\\\n\\hline 9&10&11&12\\\\\n\\hline 13&14&15&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\\] Clearly these are precisely the states which can be reached by starting from the solved state. We know that these states (when expressed as permutations of the solved state) form a subgroup of \\(A_{15}\\), we want to show that it is all of \\(A_{15}\\) (or, equivalently, all the elements of \\(A_{16}\\) which fix 16). We will do this by showing that every 3-cycle of the form \\((11\\ 12\\ i)\\) is possible and, since these cycles generate \\(A_{15}\\), the result will follow. [The rest of this section is not examinable.]\nWe first construct the 3-cycle \\((11\\ 12\\ 15)\\) in a particular way. Start by moving the empty space away from the edge of the board by exchanging it with 12 and then 11: \\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline 5&6&7&8\\\\\n\\hline 9&10&11&12\\\\\n\\hline 13&14&15&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\leadsto\n&\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline 5&6&7&8\\\\\n\\hline 9&10&&11\\\\\n\\hline 13&14&15&12\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\end{array}\\] Then rotate the tiles in the bottom right quadrant. \\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline 5&6&7&8\\\\\n\\hline 9&10&&11\\\\\n\\hline 13&14&15&12\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\leadsto\n&\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline 5&6&7&8\\\\\n\\hline 9&10&&15\\\\\n\\hline 13&14&12&11\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\end{array}\\] Finally, we undo the two moves we started with to get the space back in the corner. \\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline 5&6&7&8\\\\\n\\hline 9&10&&15\\\\\n\\hline 13&14&12&11\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\leadsto\n&\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline 5&6&7&8\\\\\n\\hline 9&10&15&11\\\\\n\\hline 13&14&12&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\end{array}\\] Representing this state as a permutation of the solved state gives \\((11\\ 12\\ 15)\\) as desired. We can construct any 3-cycle of the form \\((11\\ 12\\ i)\\) for any piece \\(i\\not\\in\\{11,12,15\\}\\) by first moving the space away from the corner (as we did above), then applying some sequence of moves to place \\(i\\) into the place originally occupied by 15 without moving 11 or 12, and ending with the space in the same position as before. If we then rotate the bottom right corner pieces, as before, and reverse the previous moves we will obtain \\((11\\ 12\\ i)\\). For example, to obtain \\((11\\ 12\\ 4)\\): \\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline 5&6&7&8\\\\\n\\hline 9&10&11&12\\\\\n\\hline 13&14&15&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\leadsto\n&\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3&4\\\\\n\\hline 5&6&7&8\\\\\n\\hline 9&10&&11\\\\\n\\hline 13&14&15&12\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\end{array}\\]\nThen identify a tour which passes through the space and 15 without hitting 11 or 12 (indicated in bold). Cycle this tour round to obtain place 4 in the position occupied by 15. \\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline {\\bf 1}&{\\bf 2}&{\\bf 3}&{\\bf 4}\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 5}&6&{\\bf 7}&{\\bf 8}\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 9}&10&&11\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 13}&{\\bf 14}&{\\bf 15}&12\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\leadsto\n&\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline {\\bf 13}&{\\bf 9}&{\\bf 5}&{\\bf 1}\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 14}&6&{\\bf 3}&{\\bf 2}\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 15}&10&&11\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 7}&{\\bf 8}&{\\bf 4}&12\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\end{array}\\]\nNow cycle the bottom right quadrant so that the 4 moves to where the 11 is now: \\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline { 13}&{ 9}&{5}&{ 1}\\\\\n\\hline { 14}&6&{ 3}&{ 2}\\\\\n\\hline { 15}&10&&11\\\\\n\\hline { 7}&{ 8}&{ 4}&12\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\leadsto\n&\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline { 13}&{ 9}&{5}&{ 1}\\\\\n\\hline { 14}&6&{ 3}&{ 2}\\\\\n\\hline { 15}&10&&4\\\\\n\\hline { 7}&{ 8}&{ 12}&11\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\end{array}\\] Finally undo the bold cycle which carried 4 into the place occupied by 15 and then move the space back to the corner to obtain \\((11\\ 12\\ 4)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline {\\bf 13}&{\\bf 9}&{\\bf 5}&{\\bf 1}\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 14}&6&{\\bf 3}&{\\bf 2}\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 15}&10&&4\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 7}&{\\bf 8}&{\\bf 12}&11\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\leadsto\n&\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline {\\bf 1}&{\\bf 2}&{\\bf 3}&{\\bf 12}\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 5}&6&{\\bf 7}&{\\bf 8}\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 9}&10&&4\\\\\n\\hline {\\bf 13}&{\\bf 14}&{\\bf 15}&11\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n&\n\\leadsto\n&\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline {1}&{2}&{3}&{12}\\\\\n\\hline {5}&6&{ 7}&{8}\\\\\n\\hline {9}&10&4&11\\\\\n\\hline { 13}&{ 14}&{15}&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\end{array}\\] Because every 3-cycle \\((11\\ 12\\ i)\\) can be formed in this way and these 3-cycles generate \\(A_{15}\\) we can obtain every even permutation of the solved state. It follows that every even permutation of the solved state can be solved! There is a subtlety here though - we are permuting positions not tiles. For example, if we want to apply \\((11\\ 12\\ 4)\\) again so as to form the permutation \\((11\\ 12\\ 4)^2=(11\\ 4\\ 12)\\) then we need to repeat the actual moves we did before so that the tile in position 4 (which is now 12) moves into the space occupied by 15.",

Formally we have:\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Group Action) A group \\(G\\) acts on a (non-empty) set \\(X\\) (or there is an action \\(*\\) of \\(G\\) on \\(X\\)) if, for each \\(g\\in G\\) and \\(x\\in X\\) there is an element \\(g*x\\in X\\) and\n\n\\(e*x=x, \\; \\forall \\, x\\in X\\),\n\\(g*(h*x)=(gh)*x, \\; \\forall \\,  g,h\\in G\\) and \\(\\forall \\, x\\in X\\).\n\n\nThe first property requires that the effect of the identity element in \\(G\\) is the identity permutation on \\(X\\) and the second says that the effect of applying \\(h\\) followed by \\(g\\) to an element of \\(X\\) is the same as applying the single element \\(gh\\). Groups acting on sets are really just thinly disguised permutation groups in that whenever a group \\(G\\) acts on a set \\(X\\) we can associate with each \\(g\\in G\\) the permutation \\(f_g\\) of \\(X\\) defined by \\(f_g(x)=g*x,\\ \\forall \\, x\\in X\\). These permutations form a subgroup of \\(S_{|X|}\\), but this group need not be isomorphic to \\(G\\), and we shall return to this later. First we consider some examples.\n\nExample 3.3  \n\nConsider the symmetric group \\(S_n\\). This acts on the set \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots, n\\}\\) by the rule \\(f \\ast x = f(x)\\). For example, for \\(f = (1 \\; 2 \\; 4)\\), then \\[\\begin{align*}\nf\\ast 1 &= 2\\\\\nf \\ast 3 &= 3.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNotice that this extends to any subgroup of \\(S_n\\), that is any subgroup \\(H \\le S_n\\) acts on the set \\(\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}\\) in the manner just described. By Cayley’s Theorem, this means that every finite group acts on a finite set (recall that in Cayley’s theorem this set is just the group elements and so every group acts on itself).\n\n\n\nExample 3.4  \n\nConsider the group \\(D_4\\). This group acts on the set \\(N = \\{1,2,\\ldots, 9\\}\\) of nine small squares in a 3x3 array as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline 1&2&3\\\\\n\\hline 4&5&6\\\\\n\\hline 7&8&9\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nUsing our notation for the symmetries of a square we have, for example,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nr_1 \\ast 7 &= 9 \\\\\nr_2 \\ast 5 &= 5 \\\\\ns_1 \\ast 3 &= 1\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nExample 3.5  \n\nLet \\(V= \\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) be the set of numbered vertices of a square as shown with symmetries defined as usual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we let \\(D_4\\) acts on the vertices of the square, then we are led to the permutation group: \\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n\\stackrel{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix},}{e} & \\stackrel{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 \\end{pmatrix},}{r_1} & \\stackrel{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix},}{r_2} & \\stackrel{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix},}{r_3} \\\\\n\\stackrel{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 \\end{pmatrix},}{s_1} & \\stackrel{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 1 & 4 & 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix},}{s_2} & \\stackrel{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix},}{s_3} & \\stackrel{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 3 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}.}{s_4}\n\\end{array}\n\\] This permutation group is isomorphic to \\(D_4\\).\nThe group \\(D_4\\) can also act on the diagonals of the square (so ignoring vertices and thinking only of how the diagonals are affected). Writing \\(d_1\\) for the main diagonal and \\(d_2\\) for the off diagonal, we see that \\(e, r_2, s_2, s_4\\) all fix the diagonals while all other elements of \\(D_4\\) swap the diagonals. We can represent this action by the permutation group: \\[\n\\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} d_1 & d_2 \\\\ d_1 & d_2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} d_1 & d_2 \\\\ d_2 & d_1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nExample 3.6  \n\nConsider the group \\(\\glr{n}\\), the group of invertible \\(n\\times n\\) matrices with real entries under matrix multiplication. This acts on the \\(\\R^{n}\\) by \\(A \\ast \\vecx = A \\vecx\\) since: \\[I \\ast \\vecx = I \\vecx = \\vec x\\] and \\[B \\ast (A \\ast \\vec x) = B \\ast (A \\vecx) = BA \\vecx = (BA) \\ast \\vecx.\\]\n\n\nAny group of functions \\(G\\) on a set \\(X\\) defines a group action \\(*\\) according to the ‘obvious’ rule \\(f*x=f(x), \\forall \\, x\\in X\\). By definition of the identity function, \\(e\\), we have \\(e*x=x, \\forall \\, x\\in X\\) and, since \\(g*(f*x)\\) means apply \\(g\\) to \\(f(x)\\), it follows immediately that \\(\\forall \\, g,f \\in G, \\,  g*(f*x)=(gf)*x\\) as they are both just \\(g(f(x))\\). However, many deep theorems of Group Theory have been proved by finding a ‘good action’. A good example is the following alternative proof to one of the main results on permutations in the Abstract Algebra module. We give an example first, followed by the proof.\n\nTheorem 3.1 No permutation can be expressed both as a product of an even number of transpositions and as a product of an odd number of transpositions.\n\n\nExample 3.7 Let \\(S_4\\) act on the set of polynomials in \\(\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}\\) by the rule \\(f:x_i \\maps x_{f(i)}\\). For example, \\[(1 \\; 2)(3 \\; 4) * (x_1^3x_2-x_3) = x_2^3x_1-x_4.\\] Now consider the polynomial \\[P=\\prod_{1 \\leq i&lt;j\\leq 4}(x_j-x_i)= (x_2-x_1)(x_3-x_2)(x_3-x_1)(x_4-x_3)(x_4-x_2)(x_4-x_1).\\] Then \\[(1 \\; 2)P = (x_1-x_2)(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)(x_4-x_3)(x_4-x_1)(x_4-x_2) = -P\\] since the only overall change is \\((x_2-x_1) \\mapsto (x_1-x_2) = -(x_2-x_1).\\) Also \\[(1 \\; 3)P = (x_2-x_3)(x_1-x_2)(x_1-x_3)(x_4-x_1)(x_4-x_2)(x_4-x_3) = -P\\] since the first three terms change parity. In fact we have that, for all \\((i \\; j) \\in S_4, \\;\\; (i \\; j)*P = -P\\).\n\nWe can now prove the theorem.\n\nProof. Let \\(S_n\\) act on the set of polynomials \\(\\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}\\) by the rule \\(f:x_i \\mapsto x_{f(i)}\\). Consider the so-called alternating polynomial \\[P = \\prod_{1 \\leq i &lt; j \\leq n} (x_j - x_i).\\] For all transpositions \\((i \\; j) \\in S_n\\), then \\((i \\; j)*P = -P\\). If \\(f\\) can be written as the product of an even number of transpositions, then \\(f*P=P\\). If \\(f\\) can be written as the product of an odd number of transpositions, then \\(f*P=-P\\). Hence, \\(f\\) cannot be expressed as the product of both an even number and an odd number of transpositions.",

For example the orbit of the group \\(\\gen{(1 \\; 2) (3 \\; 4 \\; 5 \\; 7)} \\le S_{7}\\) are \\(\\{1,2\\}, \\{3,4,5,7\\}, \\{6\\}\\).\nConsider Example 3.5: \\(D_4\\) acting on the vertices has only one orbit: \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\). However in Example 3.4, the orbits of \\(D_4\\) are \\(\\{1,3,7,9\\}, \\{2,4,6,8\\}, \\{5\\}\\).\n\n\n\nIt would appear that the orbits partition \\(X\\) and the standard way to prove the existence of a partition is to show that there is an underlying equivalence relation.\n\nLemma 3.1 Let \\(G\\) be a group acting on a set \\(X\\). Define the relation \\(\\sim\\) on \\(X\\) by \\(x\\sim y\\) if and only if \\(g*x=y\\) for some \\(g\\in G\\) (i.e. \\(x\\) is related to \\(y\\) if and only if \\(y\\) is in the orbit of \\(x\\)).

Then: \\[|\\orb(x)| \\times |\\stab(x)| = |G|.\\]\n\n\nProof. \n\nRecalling, by Lagrange’s theorem, that the index of \\(\\stab(x)\\) in \\(G\\) is precisely \\(|G|/|\\stab(x)|\\), it suffices to show that orbit \\(x\\) is in one-to-one correspondence with the left cosets of \\(\\stab(x)\\) in \\(G\\). We do this by showing that \\(g_1 \\ast x = g_2 \\ast y\\), for \\(g_1, g_2 \\in G\\) if and only if \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) belong to the same left coset.\nSuppose first that \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) belong to the same left coset of \\(\\stab(x)\\). This means that there is an \\(h \\in \\stab (x)\\) such that \\(g_1 h = g_2\\). Consequently: \\[ g_2 \\ast x = (g_1 h) \\ast x = g_1 \\ast (h \\ast x) = g_1 \\ast x\\] as required.\nSuppose on the other hand that \\(g_1 \\ast x = g_2 \\ast x\\). We then have: \\[ x = e \\ast x = (g_1^{-1}g_1) \\ast x = g_{1}^{-1}\\ast(g_1 \\ast x) = g_{1}^{-1}\\ast(g_2 \\ast x) = (g_{1}^{-1} g_2) \\ast x)\\] and we conclude that \\(g_1^{-1}g_2 \\in \\stab(x)\\). Therefore, \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) belong to the same left coset of \\(\\stab(x)\\).\n\n\nLater we will use this result to prove an important structural property of groups, namely Cauchy’s Theorem which states that if \\(p\\) is a prime divisor of the order of a group \\(G\\), then \\(G\\) contains an element (and hence a subgroup) of order \\(p\\). This is the first step towards a ‘converse’ to Lagrange’s Theorem. Before we do this, though, we prove a famous result that has many important applications.",

The key idea is to consider the set of all pairs \\((g,x)\\) such that \\(g\\ast x = x\\). We can order this set of pairs in two ways: \\[ \\{ (g,x) \\mid x \\in \\fix(g) \\} = \\{(g,x) : g \\in \\stab(x)\\}.\\] For instance, returning to Example 3.4 again, we have, under the first ordering, \\[\n\\{(e,1),(e,2),(e,3),(e,4),(s_2,1),(s_2,3),(s_4,2),(s_4,4)\\}\n\\] and under the second, \\[\n\\{(e,1),(s_2,1),(e,2),(s_4,2),(e,3)(s_2,3),(e,4),(s_4,4)\\}.\n\\] As expected the two sets are equal and consequently: \\[\\sum_{g \\in D_4}|\\fix(g)| = \\sum_{x \\in V} |\\stab(x)|\\] since both sums count the number of pairs \\((g,x)\\) such that \\(g \\ast x = x\\).\n\n\nNotice that \\(\\fix (g)\\) is a subset of \\(X\\) (as is \\(\\orb (x)\\) but not \\(\\stab (x)\\) which is a subgroup of \\(G\\)).

This is a consequence of Theorem 3.3 since for \\(x,y\\) belonging to the same orbit \\(O\\): \\[\n|\\stab(x)| = \\frac{|G|}{|O|} = |\\stab(y)|.\n\\] Therefore fixing, for each \\(1 \\le i \\le r\\) a point \\(x_i \\in O_r\\), \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{x \\in X} | \\stab(x)| &= \\sum_{x \\in O_1} | \\stab(x)| + \\sum_{x \\in O_2} | \\stab(x)| + \\ldots + \\sum_{x \\in O_r} | \\stab(x)| \\\\\n&= (|O_1| \\times |\\stab(x_1)|) + (|O_2| \\times |\\stab(x_2)|) + \\ldots + (|O_r| \\times |\\stab(x_r)|) \\\\\n&= |G| r\n\\end{align*}\\] Dividing by \\(|G|\\) yields, \\[\n\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{x \\in X} | \\stab(x)| = r.\n\\] The result is now a consequence of Lemma 3.2.",

    "text": "3.5 Colouring Problems\nBurnside’s lemma can be used to count the number of ‘essentially different’ configurations in a set. As in Graph Theory, these configurations are usually described in terms of colourings but the applications are much wider than this suggests.\n\nExample 3.12 How many essentially different ways are there of colouring the smaller equilateral triangles red, blue or yellow?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer depends on what is meant by ‘essentially’ different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may wish to consider \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) the same since we may obtain \\(2\\) from \\(1\\) by applying the symmetry \\(r_2\\) in \\(D_3\\) (rotating anticlockwise twice by \\(2\\pi/3\\)).\nIf the triangle is equilateral, then we may consider all the labellings to be equivalent, since we may obtain \\(3\\) from \\(1\\) by reflecting in the vertical axis (that is by applying the element \\(s_2\\) of \\(D_3\\)).\n\n\nTo be precise about what we mean by ‘essentially different’ we specify a group of symmetries of the figure and say that two colourings are equivalent (i.e. essentially the same) if and only if one can be transformed into the other by one of these symmetries. In other words, if we consider the action of a group of symmetries on the set of all colourings of the figure, then two colourings are equivalent if and only if they lie in the same orbit. It follows that the number of distinct colourings is just the total number of orbits, which we can find using Burnside’s Lemma.\n\nExample 3.13 In how many different ways can the square glass tile shown below, which can be turned over, be coloured\n\nusing \\(n\\) colours,\nso that there are six red and two blue regions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group acting is \\(D_4\\):\n\nThe underlying set \\(X\\) is the set of all \\(n^{8}\\) colourings of the \\(8\\) regions of the tile. Hence \\(|\\fix(e)| = |X| = n^8\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Burnside’s Lemma, the number of orbits of \\(X\\) under \\(D_4\\), that is the total number of distinct colourings, is \\[\\frac{1}{8} (n^8 + 5n^4 + 2n^2).\\]\nThere are \\(\\binom{8}{2}\\) ways of choosing the blue colored regions; the rest are colored red. Therefore the total number of colorings is \\[\\binom{8}{2} = 28.\\] This means that \\(\\fix(e) = 28\\). Looking at the working for part a., a colouring of the tile with blue and red that is fixed by \\(r_1\\) or \\(r_3\\) is either monochromatic or has at least \\(4\\) blue regions. Therefore \\(\\fix(r_1) = \\fix(r_3) = \\emptyset\\) since there are no colourings of the tile with \\(6\\) red and \\(2\\) blue regions fixed under \\(r_1\\) or \\(r_3\\).\nLooking at the working for \\(r_2\\) we need at that exactly one of \\(A,B,C,D\\) is blue (the rest are red). Thus there are \\(4\\) such colourings. A similar argument works for the reflections – each fixes \\(4\\) colourings.\nHence the number of valid colourings is: \\[\\frac{1}{8}(28 + (5 \\times 4)) = 6.\\]",

    "text": "3.6 Cauchy’s Theorem and \\(p\\)-Groups\nUp to now this chapter has been concerned with applications of (permutation) groups. The main aim of this course, however, is to examine the structure of finite groups. Lagrange’s Theorem is a structure theorem in that for any finite group \\(G\\) it rules out the existence of subgroups of \\(G\\) for any order not dividing \\(|G|\\). We know that the converse of Lagrange’s Theorem is true for abelian groups but false in general. This is not the end of the story, as we shall eventually show that if \\(|G|=p^rm\\) for some prime \\(p\\), then \\(G\\) has a subgroup of order \\(p^r\\) (and in fact of order \\(p^s\\ \\forall \\, s,\\ 0\\leq s\\leq r\\)). Our first step towards this goal is to prove that if \\(p\\) is a prime divisor of the order of a group \\(G\\), then \\(G\\) contains an element of order \\(p\\). We will illustrate the proof of this result by way of an example.\n\nExample 3.14 Consider \\(D_3=\\{e,r_1,r_2,s_1,s_2,s_3\\}\\), we will use group actions to show that at least one of these elements has order \\(3\\). Form the set \\(X\\) consisting of all triples \\((x,y,z)\\) where \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) are (not necessarily distinct) elements of \\(G\\) such that \\(xyz=e\\). Thus: \\[\\begin{align*}\nX = \\{&(e,e,e),(e,r_1,r_2),(e,r_2,r_1),(r_1,e,r_2),(r_1,r_2,e),(r_2,e,r_1),\n\\\\&(r_2,r_1,e),(e,s_1,s_1),(s_1,e,s_1),(s_1,s_1,e),(e,s_2,s_2),(s_2,e,s_2),\\\\\n&(s_2,s_2,e),(e,s_3,s_3),(s_3,e,s_3),(s_3,s_3,e),(r_1,r_1,r_1),(r_1,s_1,s_3),\\\\\n&(s_3,r_1,s_1),(s_1,s_3,r_1),(r_1,s_2,s_1),(s_1,r_1,s_2),(s_2,s_1,r_1),(r_1,s_3,s_2),\\\\\n&(s_2,r_1,s_3),(s_3,s_2,r_1),(r_2,r_2,r_2),(r_2,s_1,s_2),(s_2,r_2,s_1),(s_1,s_2,r_2),\\\\\n&(r_2,s_2,s_3),(s_3,r_2,s_2),(s_2,,s_3,r_2),(r_2,s_3,s_1),(s_1,r_2,s_3),(s_3,s_1,r_2)\\}.\n\\end{align*}\\] We see that \\(|X|=36\\). We should have expected this because for any choice of elements \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), \\((x,y,z)\\in X\\) if and only if \\(z=(xy)^{-1}\\); there are 6 choices for \\(x\\) and 6 for \\(y\\) giving \\(6\\times 6=36\\) triples in total. We now consider the action of the cyclic group \\(\\langle(1\\ 2\\ 3)\\rangle\\) on \\(X\\) defined by \\((1\\ 2\\ 3)*(x,y,z)=(z,x,y)\\). First we need to show that this is a group action on \\(X\\), so we need to show that if \\((x,y,z)\\in X\\), then \\((z,x,y)\\in X\\) and \\((y,z,x)\\in X\\). But \\(xyz=e \\Leftrightarrow z=(xy)^{-1}\\), so \\(zxy=(xy)^{-1}xy=e\\) and \\(yzx=y(xy)^{-1}x=yy^{-1}x^{-1}x=e\\) as required. What are the orbits of this action on \\(X\\)? \\[\\begin{align*}\n&\\{(e,e,e)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(e,r_1,r_2),(r_2,e,r_1),(r_1,r_2,e)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(e,r_2,r_1),(r_1,e,r_2),(r_2,r_1,e)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(e,s_1,s_1),(s_1,e,s_1),(s_1,s_1,e)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(e,s_2,s_2),(s_2,e,s_2),(s_2,s_2,e)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(e,s_3,s_3),(s_3,e,s_3),(s_3,s_3,e)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(r_1,r_1,r_1)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(r_1,s_1,s_3),(s_3,r_1,s_1),(s_1,s_3,r_1)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(r_1,s_2,s_1),(s_1,r_1,s_2),(s_2,s_1,r_1)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(r_1,s_3,s_2),(s_2,r_1,s_3),(s_3,s_2,r_1)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(r_2,r_2,r_2)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(r_2,s_1,s_2),(s_2,r_2,s_1),(s_1,s_2,r_2)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(r_2,s_2,s_3),(s_3,r_2,s_2),(s_2,s_3,r_2)\\}\\\\\n&\\{(r_2,s_3,s_1),(s_1,r_2,s_3),(s_3,s_1,r_2)\\}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe see that the orbits are all either of size 1 or of size 3, moreover the orbits of size 1 are of the form \\(\\{(g,g,g)\\}\\) where \\(g\\) is either the identity or an element of order 3. Could we have anticipated this? Under the action described any orbit of size 1 is necessarily of the form \\(\\{(g,g,g)\\}\\) and hence \\(g^3=e\\); clearly \\(\\{(e,e,e)\\}\\) will give us one such orbit and any further orbits of size 1 will correspond to elements of order 3. So \\(D_3\\) contains an element of order 3 if and only if \\(\\{(e,e,e)\\}\\) is not the only orbit of size 1 in \\(X\\) under this action. Let there be \\(s\\) orbits of size 1 and \\(t\\) orbits of size \\(3\\), so \\(|X|=s+3t\\), but we know that \\(|X|=36\\), so \\(s=36-3t=3(12-t)\\). It follows that \\(s\\) is at least 1 and also a multiple of 3, so there are at least 3 orbits of size 1 with at least 2 corresponding to elements of order 3.\n\n\nTheorem 3.5 (Cauchy’s Theorem) Let \\(G\\) be a finite group of order \\(n\\) and let \\(p\\) be a prime divisor of \\(n\\). Then \\(G\\) has an element of order \\(p\\) and, consequently, a subgroup of order \\(p\\).\n\n\nProof. The proof that follows is non-examinable.\nLet \\(n=mp\\) and \\(X = \\{(g_1, g_2, \\ldots, g_p) \\in G \\times G \\times \\ldots \\times G \\where g_1g_2\\ldots g_p = e \\}\\).\nNote that \\(|X|=n^{p-1}\\) since, for any choice of \\(g_1, g_2, \\ldots, g_{p-1}\\) in \\(G\\) (and there are \\(n\\) choices for each of the \\(g_i\\) in the list), we set \\(g_p = (g_1g_2\\ldots g_{p-1})^{-1}.\\) But \\(|X|=n^{p-1} = (pm)^{p-1}\\) so \\(p\\) divides \\(|X|\\). Consider the group action of \\(\\langle (1 \\; 2 \\; \\ldots \\; p) \\rangle\\) on \\(X\\) defined by \\[(1 \\; 2 \\; \\ldots \\; p) * (g_1, g_2, \\ldots, g_p) = (g_2, \\ldots, g_p, g_1).\\] For this to be an action on \\(X\\) we need to show that \\[(1 \\; 2 \\; \\ldots \\; p)^r * (g_1, g_2, \\ldots, g_p) = (g_{r+1}, \\ldots, g_p, g_1, \\ldots, g_r) \\in X.\\] But \\(g_{r+1} \\ldots g_{p-1} g_p g_1 \\ldots g_r = g_{r+1} \\ldots g_{p-1} (g_{p-1}^{-1} \\ldots g_{r+1}^{-1} g_r^{-1} \\ldots g_2^{-1}g_1^{-1})g_1 \\ldots g_r = e \\in X\\), as required.\nNext consider the orbits of \\(X\\) under this action. We know that the size of each orbit divides the order of \\(\\langle (1 \\; 2 \\; \\ldots \\; p) \\rangle\\), which is \\(p\\). Therefore, each orbit has size 1 or \\(p\\). But an orbit has size 1 if and only if it is of the form \\(\\{(g, g, \\ldots, g) \\}\\) and hence \\(g^p = e\\), so either \\(g = e\\) or \\(g\\) is an element of order \\(p\\).\nSince \\(|X|\\) is a multiple of \\(p\\) and \\(|X|\\) is the sum of the sizes of the orbits, we have that the number of orbits of size 1 is also a multiple of \\(p\\) (possible zero), but \\(\\{ e, e, \\ldots, e \\}\\) is one such orbit, so there must be at least \\(p-1\\) further orbits of size 1, and each of these is of the form \\(\\{(g, g, \\ldots, g) \\}\\) where \\(g \\neq e\\) is an element of order \\(p\\).\n\nWe now introduce an important class of groups.\n\nDefinition 3.5 (\\(p\\)-groups and \\(p\\)-subgroups) A group is called a p-group if and only if every element in \\(G\\) has order a power of the prime \\(p\\). A subgroup of a group \\(G\\) is a p-subgroup of \\(G\\) if the subgroup is itself a \\(p\\)-group.\n\nIt is not immediately obvious that finite \\(p\\)-groups are exactly the groups of order \\(p^n\\).\n\nTheorem 3.6 Let \\(G\\) be a finite group. Then \\(G\\) is a \\(p\\)-group if and only if \\(|G|\\) is a power of \\(p\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nIf \\(|G|\\) is a power of \\(p\\), then by Lagrange’s Theorem, the order of every element of \\(|G|\\) is also a power of \\(p\\) (since it has to divide the order of \\(|G|\\)).\nSuppose \\(G\\) is a \\(p\\)-group. If \\(q\\) is a prime dividing \\(|G|\\), then by Cauchy’s Theorem (Theorem 3.5), there is an element of \\(G\\) of order \\(q\\). This means that the only prime dividing \\(G\\) must be \\(q\\) and so the order of \\(G\\) must be a power of \\(p\\).",

    "text": "3.7 Problem Sheet 3\nFor Week 7; covers Chapter 3. At minimum you should attempt questions 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.1\n\n\nConsider the group \\(D_6\\) (the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon) acting on the set, \\(X\\), of vertices of the regular hexagon shown below and numbered sequentially 1 to 6 in an anticlockwise direction with the upper left vertex being number 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing our standard notation for the elements of \\(D_6\\):\n\nfind the orbits of \\(X\\);\nfind the stabiliser of each element of \\(X\\);\nshow how your results in parts a. and b. above demonstrate the Orbit-Stabiliser Theorem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 3.1\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.1\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{orb}(1) = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} = \\text{orb}(2) = \\text{orb}(3) = \\text{orb}(4) = \\text{orb}(5) = \\text{orb}(6)\\), so there is just the one orbit of \\(X\\).\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\text{stab}(1) &= \\{e, s_6\\} = \\text{stab}(4)\\\\\n\\text{stab}(2) &= \\{e, s_4\\} = \\text{stab}(5)\\\\\n\\text{stab}(3) &= \\{e, s_2\\} = \\text{stab}(6).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nConsider \\(g \\in X\\). Then \\(|\\text{orb}(g)| \\times |\\text{stab}(g)| = 6 \\times 2 = 12 = |D_4|\\). This is true for all \\(g \\in X\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.2\n\n\nIn how many ways can the edges of a regular octagon be coloured with four different colours if two colourings are indistinguishable when one can be obtained from the other by\n\na rotation of the octagon.\na rotation or reflection of the octagon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 3.2\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.2\n\n\n\nHere we are considering the action of the subgroup of \\(D_8\\) that consists of the identity and the seven rotations, That is \\(G = \\{e, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6, r_7, \\}\\). There are four colour choices for each of the eight edges. This gives \\[|X| = 4^8 = 65,536 = |\\,  \\text{fix}(e) \\, |.\\] It is important to remember, in what follows, that when we label an edge with a letter, we are not referring directly to a particular colour; the letterings relate to the relationships between edges and their respective colours. So, for a given letter we have a free choice of colour, but having made that choice then that colour must be used wherever that letter appears. In general, for a regular \\(n\\)-gon, the rotations will be of \\(\\frac{i2\\pi}{n}\\) radians where \\(i\\) is an integer such that \\(0 \\leq i &lt; n\\). Now, for the colourings to be indistinguishable under the rotations where \\(i\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime (that is, in this case, odd \\(i\\) since \\(n\\) is 8) all of the edges must have the same colour. So we have that \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(r_1) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(r_3) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(r_5) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(r_7) \\, | = 4. \\] For the rotations of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) radians, that is \\(r_2\\) and \\(r_6\\), we can have the following configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis, in terms of colours, means that we either use just two colours, in which case they must alternate around the edges, or just the same colour for each edge. So, we have \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(r_2) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(r_6) \\, | = 4^2 = 16. \\]\nThe remaining rotation, that is \\(r_4\\) through \\(\\pi\\) radians, requires the following configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, we have \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(r_4) \\, | = 4^4 = 256. \\] Then, by Burnside’s Lemma, the number of orbits (and, hence, the number of distinct colourings) is \\[\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum \\, |\\, \\text{fix}(g) \\, | = \\frac{1}{8} \\, ( 4^8 + (4 \\times 4) + (2 \\times 4^2) + 4^4 ) = 8230.\\]\nHere we are considering the action of the full dihedral group \\(D_8\\) and so as well as the rotations discussed above we also need to look at the reflections. Note that there are two types of lines of symmetry; vertex to opposite vertex and midpoint of edge to midpoint of opposite edge. For vertex to vertex we have the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(s_1) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_3) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_5) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_7) \\, | = 4^4 = 256. \\]\nFor midpoint to midpoint we have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(s_2) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_4) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_6) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_8) \\, | = 4^5 = 1024. \\] It is important to note, in this last case, that using five letters does not imply that we need five colours! Then, by Burnside’s Lemma, the number of orbits (and, hence, the number of distinct colourings) is \\[\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum \\, |\\, \\text{fix}(g) \\, |  = \\frac{1}{16} \\, ( 4^8 + (4 \\times 4) + (2 \\times 4^2) + 4^4 + (4 \\times 4^4) + (4 \\times 4^5)) = 4435.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.3\n\n\nUse Burnside’s Lemma to count the distinguishable colourings of the edges of\n\na square,\na regular pentagon,\n\nusing at most three colours under the relevant full dihedral group of symmetries in each case.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 3.3\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.3\n\n\n\nThe square: Here we are considering the action of the dihedral group \\(D_4\\) that consists of the identity, three rotations and four reflections. We will use the usual notation with \\(r_i\\) being an anticlockwise rotation through \\(\\frac{i \\pi}{2}\\) radians and the reflections being \\(s_i\\) where \\(i = 1, 2, 3, 4\\). Note, in particular, that the lines of reflection 1 and 3 are midpoint to midpoint whilst 2 and 4 are vertex to vertex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three colour choices for each of the four edges. This gives \\[|X| = 3^4 = 81 = |\\,  \\text{fix}(e) \\, |.\\] For the rotations (noting that 1 and 3 are relatively prime to 4) we have \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(r_1) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(r_3) \\, |  = 3. \\] and \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(r_2) \\, | = 3^2 = 9. \\] For the reflections (using the principles established in Q1) we have\\[|\\, \\text{fix}(s_1) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_3) \\, |  = 3^3 = 27. \\] and \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(s_2) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_4) \\, | = 3^2 = 9. \\] Then, by Burnside’s Lemma, the number of orbits (and, hence, the number of distinct colourings) is \\[\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum \\, |\\, \\text{fix}(g) \\, |  = \\frac{1}{8} \\, ( 81 + (2 \\times 3) + 9 + (2 \\times 3^2) + (2 \\times 3^3)) = 21.\\]\nThe pentagon: The case for a regular pentagon is straightforward. \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(e) \\, | = 3^5 = 243.\\] Since the number of sides is prime, the size of the fix for all rotations is the same (since for each \\(r_i\\) we have that \\(i\\) is relatively prime to 5). Hence \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(r_i) \\, | = 3 \\quad \\forall i,  \\; i = 1, 2, 3, 4. \\] Furthermore, as there is only one type of reflection (each one passes from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side) we have\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[|\\, \\text{fix}(s_i) \\, | = 3^3 = 27 \\quad \\forall i,  \\; i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\\] Then, by Burnside’s Lemma, the number of orbits (and, hence, the number of distinct colourings) is \\[\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum \\, |\\, \\text{fix}(g) \\, |  = \\frac{1}{10} \\, ( 243 + (4 \\times 3) + (5 \\times 27)) = 39.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.4\n\n\nUse Burnside’s Lemma to count the distinguishable colourings of the edges of a square with four distinct colours when two colourings are indistinguishable if one can be obtained from the other by\n\na rotation of the square,\na rotation or reflection of the square.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 3.4\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.4\n\n\nWe use the same reasoning as in the previous examples.\n\nRotation of the square: There are four colour choices for each of the four edges. This gives \\[|X| = 4^4 = 256 = |\\,  \\text{fix}(e) \\, |.\\] For the rotations (noting that 1 and 3 are relatively prime to 4) we have \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(r_1) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(r_3) \\, |  = 4. \\] (all edges have the same colour), and \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(r_2) \\, | = 4^2 = 16. \\] (opposite edges have the same colour). Then, by Burnside’s Lemma, the number of distinct colourings is \\[\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum \\, |\\, \\text{fix}(g) \\, |  = \\frac{1}{4} \\, ( 256 + 16 + (2 \\times 4)) = 70.\\]\nRotation or reflection of the square: We need, in addition to the above, to consider the reflections in addition to the rotations. So, the whole of \\(D_4\\) is acting. For the reflections we have: \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(s_1) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_3) \\, |  = 4^3 = 64. \\] and \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(s_2) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_4) \\, | = 4^2 = 16. \\]\nThen, by Burnside’s Lemma, the number of orbits (and, hence, the number of distinct colourings) is \\[\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum \\, |\\, \\text{fix}(g) \\, |  = \\frac{1}{8} \\, ( 256 + 16 + (2 \\times 4) + (2 \\times 4^2) + (2 \\times 4^3)) = 55.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.5\n\n\nUse Burnside’s Lemma to enumerate the distinguishable colourings of the regions of the following square grid using at most two colours:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunder the group of rotations of the square;\nunder the full dihedral group \\(D_4\\).\n\nGive an example of two colourings that are distinguishable in part a. but not in part b.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 3.5\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.5\n\n\n\nrotations of the square: The number of distinguishable colourings is given by the number of orbits of the action of the rotation group, \\(\\{e, r_1, r_2, r_3 \\}\\), on the set of all colourings of the figure. We use the usual notation. There are just two colour choices for each of the nine regions. This gives \\[|X| = 2^9 = 512 = |\\,  \\text{fix}(e) \\, |.\\] For the rotations \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_3\\) (noting that 1 and 3 are relatively prime to 4) we must have that each of the corner squares must be the same colour as each other and each of the mid-side squares must be the same colour as each other (though not necessarily different from the corner squares), with the centre square being any of the two colours we choose. Thus: \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(r_1) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(r_3) \\, |  = 2^3 = 8. \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand for the rotation \\(r_2\\) (through \\(\\pi\\) radians) we have the following: \\[|\\, \\text{fix}(r_2) \\, | = 2^5 = 32. \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, by Burnside’s Lemma, the number of distinct colourings is \\[\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum \\, |\\, \\text{fix}(g) \\, |  = \\frac{1}{4} \\, ( 512 + 2^5 + (2 \\times 8)) = 140.\\]\nunder the full dihedral group \\(D_4\\)\nFor the reflections we note that there are two types of line of symmetry; vertex to vertex and mid-point to mid-point. For mid-point to mid-point we have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[|\\, \\text{fix}(s_1) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_3) \\, |  = 2^6 = 64. \\] For vertex to vertex we have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[|\\, \\text{fix}(s_2) \\, | = |\\, \\text{fix}(s_4) \\, |  = 2^6 = 64. \\] Then, by Burnside’s Lemma, the number of distinct colourings is (taking into account rotations and reflections) \\[\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum \\, |\\, \\text{fix}(g) \\, |  = \\frac{1}{8} \\, ( 512 + 2^5 + (2 \\times 8) + (4 \\times 2^6)) = 102.\\]\n\nNote that for all rotations, colourings will be distinguishable if any given pair of diametrically opposed squares are not of the same colour. All we then need to do is to construct a colouring with that property but which has reflective symmetry about a line of symmetry. Given what we have said about diagonally opposed pairs, it makes sense to use a line of symmetry that is mid-point to mid-point, and we shall use the vertical line. So, in the diagram below, no rotation will turn the configuration on the left to the one on the right, but the right configuration is a reflection of the left configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.6\n\n\nA teacher has a bank of \\(n\\) test questions and wants to assign to each of 3 students, \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), one of the \\(n\\) questions in this bank. The teacher is not concerned if the same question is assigned to more than one student, and is not concerned about the order in which the questions are assigned to the students. Using Burnside’s Lemma determine the number of essentially different ways of assigning a question from the bank to each student.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 3.7\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.7\n\n\nLet \\(X\\) be the set of all valid assignment of test questions to the students. The size of \\(X\\) is \\(n^3\\) (since the same question can be assigned to more than \\(1\\) student).\nLet \\(T_1, T_2, T_3\\) be test questions, write \\(T_1T_2T_3\\) for the assignment \\(T_1 \\to A\\), \\(T_2 \\to B\\) and \\(T_3 \\to C\\). Since the teacher is not concerned about the order in which questions are allocated to students, we consider two assignments equal if they use the same test questions. In particular if \\(T_1, T_2\\) and \\(T_3\\) are test questions, then the assigment \\(T_1T_2T_3\\) is equivalent to any assigment in the set\n\\[\\{T_1T_2T_3,T_1T_3T_2, T_2T_1T_3, T_2T_3T_1, T_3T_1T_2, T_3T_2T_1\\}.\\] In particular, two assignments \\(T_1T_2T_3\\) and \\(t_1t_2t_3\\) are equal if there is an element \\(\\sigma \\in S_3\\) such that \\(t_1t_2t_3 = T_{\\sigma(1)}T_{\\sigma(2)}T_{\\sigma(3)}\\).\nNow that we know what the acting group is, we can apply Burnside’s Lemma.\nThe identity permutation fixes all assignments: \\(|\\fix(())|| = n^3\\).\nAn assigment is fixed by a three cycle, if and only if it is of the form \\(TTT\\) for \\(T\\) a test question. Therefore for \\(\\sigma\\) a three cycle, \\(|\\fix(\\sigma)| = n\\).\nThe 2-cycle \\((1 \\ 2)\\) fixes all assigments of the form \\(TTT'\\) for \\(T\\) and \\(T'\\) test questions. Thus \\(|\\fix((1\\ 2))| = n^2\\). A similar argument holds for the other 2-cycles. In particular, for \\(\\sigma\\) a 2-cycle, \\(|\\fix(\\sigma)| = n^2\\).\nBy Burnside’s Lemma, the number of essentiall different assigments, is:\n\\[ \\frac{n^3 + 2n + 3n^2}{6}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.7\n\n\nConsider the proof of Cauchy’s Theorem with \\(G = D_5\\) and \\(p = 5\\). Describe the set \\(X\\) and the group acting on \\(X\\). Determine the possible sizes of the orbits in \\(X\\) under this action and write out, in full, two distinct orbits for each of these possible sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 3.7\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.7\n\n\n\\(X = \\{(g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4, g_5) \\in G^5 \\; | \\; g_1g_2g_3g_4g_5 = e \\}\\) so \\(|X| = 10^4 = 2^4 \\times 5^4\\), which is a multiple of 5. The group acting on \\(X\\) is \\(\\langle (1 \\; 2 \\; 3 \\; 4 \\; 5) \\rangle\\) which is the cyclic group of order 5 and since the size of each orbit divides 5 this must have size either 1 or 5. Orbits of size 1 correspond to the identity or elements of order 5, so two such orbits are \\[\\{(e, e, e, e, e)\\} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\{(r_1, r_1, r_1, r_1, r_1) \\}.\\] Orbits of size 5 can take a variety of forms, but two simple examples (which are independent of how we define \\(D_5\\)) are \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\{&(e, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4), (r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, e), (r_2, r_3, r_4, e, r_1),\\\\ &(r_3, r_4, e, r_1, r_2), (r_4, e, r_1, r_2, r_3)\\}\n\\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\{&(s_1, s_1, s_2, s_2, e), (s_1, s_2, s_2, e, s_1), (s_2, s_2, e, s_1, s_1),\\\\ &(s_2, e, s_1, s_1, s_2), (e, s_1, s_1, s_2, s_2)\\}.\n\\end{align*}\\]",

    "text": "4.1 Normal Subgroups and Quotient Groups\nLet \\(H\\) be a subgroup of a group \\(G\\). Now \\(H\\) has both left and right cosets and, in general, a left coset \\(aH, \\; a \\in G,\\) need not be the same as the right coset \\(Ha\\). Suppose we try to define a binary operation on left cosets as follows: \\[(aH)(bH) = (ab)H. \\tag{4.1}\\]\nIt is important to realise that this rule does not necessarily define a binary operation on the left cosets of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\). This is because it is defined in terms of elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) but, in general, the cosets will have other representatives and we need to show that it does not matter which representative we choose (this is the same as the situation involving the representatives of the equivalence classes modulo some integer \\(m\\)).\nFirst recall that \\(a' \\in aH\\) and \\(b' \\in bH\\) if and only if \\(aH = a'H\\) and \\(bH = b'H\\) (cosets are either distinct or equal).\nSecond, recall that a binary operation gives a unique result. In particular for Equation 4.1 to define a binary operation, we must have that \\[\n(aH)(bH) = (a'H)(b'H)  \n\\] or, equivalently, \\[\n  (ab)H = (a'b')H.\n\\]\nConsider the case where \\(G=D_3\\) and \\(H= \\{e,r_1,r_2\\}\\). We have: \\[\\begin{align*}\nH &= r_1 H = r_2 H = \\{e,r_1,r_2\\} \\\\\ns_1H &= s_2H = s_3H = \\{s_1,s_2,s_3\\}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIt then follows, for example, that: \\[\\begin{align*}\n(r_1H)(s_1H)&=(r_1s_1)H = s_3 H \\\\\n(r_1H)(s_2H)&=(r_1s_2)H = s_1 H \\\\\n(r_2H)(s_3H)&=(r_2s_3)H = s_1 H\n\\end{align*}\\] In particular, we see that: \\[\n(r_1H)(s_1H) = (r_1H)(s_2H) = (r_2H)(s_3H)\n\\]\nNote that, although we have changed the representative of the coset, this does not alter the outcome.\nBut, suppose \\(G  = D_3\\), \\(H = \\{e,s_1\\}\\). The distinct left cosets are, \\[\\{e,s_1\\} = eH = s_1H; \\ \\{r_1, s_3\\} = r_1H = s_3H; \\ \\{r_2,s_2\\} = r_2H = s_2H.\\]\nThen, \\[\\begin{align*}\n(eH)(r_1H) &= (er_1H) = r_1H\\\\\n(s_1H)(s_3H) &= (s_1s_3H) = r_2H\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\] but \\(r_1H \\ne r_2H\\). In this example, Equation Equation 4.1 does not define a binary operation.\nIt is important to realise what this does (and does not) mean.\nWith \\(G = D_3\\) and \\(H \\in \\{e,r_1,r_2\\}\\), then \\[\\begin{align*}\ns_1H &= \\{ s_1 e,s_1r_1, s_1r_2 \\} = \\{s_1,s_2,s_3 \\} \\\\\nHs_1 &= \\{es_1, r_1s_1,r_2s_2\\} = \\{s_1,s_2,s_3\\}.\n\\end{align*}\\] So \\(s_1H = Hs_1\\) even though \\(s_1 r_1 \\ne r_1 s_1\\) for instance. However, for \\(H = \\{e,s_1\\}\\) \\[\\begin{align*}\nr_1H &= \\{ r_1 e,r_1s_1\\} = \\{r_1,s_3 \\} \\\\\nHr_1 &= \\{er_1, s_1r_1\\} = \\{r_1,s_2\\}.\n\\end{align*}\\] so \\(r_1H \\ne Hr_1\\).`\nWe shall often use the notation \\(H \\norm G\\) to denote that \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\). The next Lemma tells us that \\((*)\\) defines a binary operation provided that, for all elements of the group, the left and right cosets coincide for a given subgroup. The Lemma is, in fact, an ‘if and only if’ statement; we prove only the forward implication below as the converse does not add anything to what we need.\n(It does not matter which representative we choose in any given coset - in this context that is what we mean by well-defined.)\nAs a convention we will often use \\(N\\) to denote a normal subgroup. The following result is the one towards which we have been building.\nThe group \\(G/N\\) in the above theorem is called the quotient or factor group of \\(G\\) with \\(N\\). The following Lemma gives the standard way of showing that a subgroup is normal.\nFor any non-abelian group an important normal subgroup of \\(G\\) is the centre of G. This consists of all the elements that commute with every other element of the group.\nObviously, a group is abelian if and only if \\(Z(G) = G\\), so this concept is only of interest for non-abelian groups. That the centre forms a normal subgroup is the content of the next theorem.",

Let \\(g \\in G\\) and \\(h \\in H\\). Since \\(gH = Hg\\) there is an element \\(k \\in H\\) such that \\(gh = kg\\). Post-multiplying by \\(g^{-1}\\) now yields: \\[ gh\\ginv = kg\\ginv = ke = k.\\] Therefore \\(gh\\ginv \\in H\\). Since \\(h \\in H\\) was arbitrary, we conclude that \\(gH\\ginv \\subseteq H\\).\nNow suppose that \\(gH\\ginv \\subseteq H\\) for all \\(g \\in G\\). Let \\(g \\in G\\). Let \\(gh \\in gH\\) be arbitrary. Then, \\[gh = ghe =  gh(g^{-1}g) = (ghg^{-1})g = kg\\] where \\(k \\in H\\) is equal to \\(ghg^{-1}\\) since by assumption \\(gHg^{-1}\\subseteq H\\). Therefore we conclude that \\(gh \\in Hg\\). Since \\(h \\in H\\) was arbitrary we see that \\(gH \\subseteq Hg\\)\nSimilarly, given \\(k \\in H\\), then observe that \\(kg = gg^{-1}kg\\). Since \\(g^{-1}\\in G\\), then by assumption, \\(g^{-1}Hg \\subseteq H\\) and so there is \\(h \\in H\\) such that \\(g^{-1}kg = h\\). Therefore, \\[kg = g(g^{-1}kg) = gh \\in gH.\\] We conclude that \\(Hg \\subseteq gH\\) and so \\(Hg = gH\\).\nSince \\(g \\in G\\) was arbitrary, we conclude that \\(gH = Hg\\) for all \\(g \\in G\\) and \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 4.2 (Centre) Let \\(G\\) be a group and \\(z, g \\in G\\), then the centre of \\(G\\) is denoted and defined by \\[Z(G) = \\{ z \\in G \\; | \\; zg = gz, \\; \\forall \\, g \\in G \\}.\\]\n\n\n\nTheorem 4.2 The centre of a group \\(G\\) forms a normal subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nFirst observe that \\(Z(G)\\) if it is a subgroup must be a normal subgroup. This follows since for \\(z \\in Z(G)\\) and \\(g \\in G\\) \\[\ngz\\ginv = g \\ginv z = z.\n\\] Therefore \\(gZ(G)\\ginv = Z(G)\\) for all \\(g \\in G\\).\nWe now show that \\(Z(G)\\) is a subgroup.\nFirst notice that \\(e \\in Z(G)\\) since \\(eg = ge = g\\) for all \\(g \\in G\\).\nLet \\(y,z \\in Z(G)\\) and consider \\(yz\\).

    "text": "4.2 Further Examples of Normal Subgroups\n\nExample 4.5 For any group \\(G\\), the trivial subgroup \\(\\{e\\}\\) is normal and, since \\(\\{e \\}\\) contains only one element, every coset of \\(\\{e\\}\\) contains only one element. It is therefore easy to see that \\[G/\\{e\\} \\cong G\\] since all we have done is to rename \\(g \\in G\\) by the coset \\(g\\{e\\} = \\{g\\}\\).\n\n\nExample 4.6 At the other extreme, we have that for any group \\(G\\), \\(G\\) itself is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) and \\(G/G\\) is the trivial group — the group of order 1.\n\nThese two extremes of quotient groups are of little importance because they tell us nothing new about the structure of \\(G\\). We now consider an example where \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) and has half the size of \\(G\\). Consider \\(a \\in G \\backslash H\\) (so \\(a \\notin H\\)); then \\(aH\\) must be all of \\(G \\backslash H\\) (because \\(H\\) and \\(aH\\) are disjoint and of equal size and \\(a \\in aH\\)) and, similarly, \\(Ha\\) must be all of \\(G \\backslash H\\), so \\(aH = Ha\\). Thus it follows that any subgroup that is half the size of the group must be normal in that group and \\(|G| = 2 |N|\\).\n\nExample 4.7 Since \\(|S_n| = 2|A_n|\\) we have that \\(A_n\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(S_n\\) and \\(S_n/A_n\\) has order 2. If \\(\\sigma\\) is any odd permutation, for example \\((1 \\; 2) \\in S_n\\), then \\(\\sigma \\in S_n \\backslash A_n\\), the elements of \\(S_n/A_n\\) are \\(\\{A_n, \\sigma A_n\\}\\) and its Cayley table is:\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n& A_n & \\sigma A_n\\\\\n\\hline\nA_{n} & A_{n} & \\sigma A_{n}  \\\\\n\\sigma A_{n} & \\sigma A_{n} & A_{n}  \n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\nExample 4.8 Lagrange’s Theorem states that if \\(H\\) is a subgroup of a finite group \\(G\\), then the order of \\(H\\) divides the order of \\(G\\). In the Abstract Algebra module we stated that the converse is false; we are now in a position to prove this by showing that \\(A_4\\), which has order 12, contains no subgroup of order 6.\n\n\nProof. Suppose \\(A_4\\) had a subgroup \\(N\\) of order \\(6\\), then \\(N\\) must be a normal subgroup as it has only \\(2\\) left cosets \\(N\\) and \\(\\sigma N\\) for any \\(\\sigma \\in A_4 \\backslash N\\). Let \\(\\sigma\\) be any element of \\(A_4\\) that is not an element of \\(N\\), we can write down the Cayley table of the quotient group \\(A_4/N\\),\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n& N & \\sigma N\\\\\n\\hline\nN & N & \\sigma N  \\\\\n\\sigma N & \\sigma N & N  \n\\end{array}\\]\nNotice that \\[NN = (eN)(eN) =  N = (\\sigma \\sigma N) = \\sigma N \\sigma N.\\] From this it follows that for any \\(\\sigma \\in A_4\\), \\((\\sigma^2 )N =N\\). This means that \\(\\sigma^2 \\in N\\) for any \\(\\sigma \\in A_4\\). However for any three cycle \\((a \\; b \\; c)\\), it square, \\((a \\; c \\; b)\\) is also a three cycle. This means that \\(N\\) contains all three cycles. However \\(A_4\\) has \\(8\\) three cycles and so \\(|N| &gt; 8\\) which is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.9 Classify the quotient group \\((\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6)/ \\langle (0, 1) \\rangle\\) according to the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups.\n\nLet \\[N = \\gen{(0,1)} = \\{(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3)(0,4),(0,5)\\}.\\] Since \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6 = 24\\), then \\((\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6)/N\\) has order \\(4\\). By the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups, \\((\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6)/N\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_4\\) or \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\).\nNotice that each of \\((1,0), (2,0)\\) and \\((3,0)\\) give rise to distinct cosets since \\((a,0)((b,0))^{-1} = (ab^{-1},0) \\notin N\\) for any \\(a,b \\in Z_4\\) with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) not both \\(0\\). Therefore the quotient group \\((\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6)/N\\) is generated by \\((1,0)N\\) since \\((1,0)^2N =((1,0)N)^2 = (2,0)N\\), \\((1,0)^3 N =((1,0)N)^3 = (3,0)N\\) and \\((1,0)^4N = ((1,0)N)^4 = N\\).\n\n\nThe above example is a special case of the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 4.3 Let \\(G = H \\times K\\) be the direct product of groups \\(H\\) and \\(K\\). Then \\[\\overline{K} = \\{ (e, k) \\; | \\; k \\in K \\}\\] is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) isomorphic to \\(K\\) and \\(G / \\overline{K} \\cong H\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nIt is easily verified that \\(\\overline{K}\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) and the map \\((e,k) \\mapsto k\\) from \\(\\overline{K} \\to K\\) is an isomorphism.\nLet \\((h,k) \\in G\\) be arbitrary, then: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  (h,k)\\overline{K} &= \\{ (h,k)(e,k'): k' \\in K \\}\\\\\n                    &= \\{ (h,kk'): k' \\in K \\}\\\\\n                    &= \\{ (h,k''): k'' \\in K \\}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, \\((h,k)\\overline{K} = \\{(h,k'): k' \\in K\\}\\). Similarly, \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\overline{K}(h,k) &= \\{ (h,k'k): k' \\in K \\}\\\\\n                    &= \\{ (h,k''): k'' \\in K \\}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, \\[(h,k)\\overline{K} =\\overline{K}(h,k)\\] and \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup.\nObserve that the order of \\(G/\\overline{K}\\) is equal to the order of \\(H\\). Moreover, for all \\(h_1,h_2 \\in H\\) with \\(h_1 \\ne h_2\\), \\[(h_1,e) K  = \\{ (h_1,k): k \\in K \\} \\ne \\{(h_2, k): k \\in K\\} =  (h_2,e) K.\\] Therefore, the left cosets of \\(\\overline{K}\\) (the elements of \\(G/\\overline{K}\\)) are \\[\\{ (h,e)\\overline{K} : h \\in H\\}.\\]\nIt now follows that the map \\(\\phi: G/\\overline{K} \\to H\\) by \\((h,e)\\overline{K} \\mapsto h\\) is an isomorphism.\n\n\nThe following two examples provide further twists on looking at subgroups of the right-hand factor of the direct product, in the sense that in Example 4.10 and Example 4.9, the cyclic subgroup makes no contribution to the left-hand factor whereas that will not be the case in Example 4.11.\n\nExample 4.10 Classify the quotient group \\((\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6)/ \\langle (0, 2) \\rangle\\) according to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.\n\\(\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n&\\text{Order}&\\hspace{1cm}\\theta: G \\rightarrow \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2\\\\\n\\hline\n\\vphantom{\\D \\frac{a}{b}} \\quad \\kbar = \\langle (0, 2) \\rangle = \\{ \\hspace {6cm} \\}&1&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\vphantom{\\D \\frac{a}{b}}(1, 0) + \\langle (0, 2) \\rangle = \\{ \\hspace {6cm} \\}&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\vphantom{\\D \\frac{a}{b}}(0, 1) + \\langle (0, 2) \\rangle = \\{ \\hspace {6cm} \\}&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\vphantom{\\D \\frac{a}{b}}(2, 0) + \\langle (0, 2) \\rangle = \\{ \\hspace {6cm} \\}&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\vphantom{\\D \\frac{a}{b}}(3, 0) + \\langle (0, 2) \\rangle = \\{ \\hspace {6cm} \\}&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\vphantom{\\D \\frac{a}{b}}(1, 1) + \\langle (0, 2) \\rangle = \\{ \\hspace {6cm} \\}&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\vphantom{\\D \\frac{a}{b}}(2, 1) + \\langle (0, 2) \\rangle = \\{ \\hspace {6cm} \\}&\\\\\n\\hline\n\\vphantom{\\D \\frac{a}{b}}(3, 1) + \\langle (0, 2) \\rangle = \\{ \\hspace {6cm} \\}&\\\\\n\\end{array}\\)\n\nThe group \\(G = (\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6)/ \\langle (0, 2) \\rangle\\) has order \\(24/3 = 8\\) and isomorphic to \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2\\).

Notice that once we specify the images of the generators \\((1,0) + \\overline{K}\\) and \\((0,2) + \\overline{K}\\) the remaining terms are determined.

    "text": "4.3 The Correspondence Theorem\nIn general, a finite quotient group \\(G/N\\) will be smaller than \\(G\\) and we may hope that it has a simpler structure. It would be nice if knowing the structure of \\(G/N\\) helped us to understand the structure of \\(G\\). Our main result, in this regard, is the following theorem which we state for finite groups (the statement is also true for infinite groups, but the proof is longer and we shall only use the finite case).\n\nTheorem 4.4 (The Correspondence Theorem) Let \\(N\\) be a normal subgroup of a finite group \\(G\\). Then \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) containing \\(N\\) if and only if \\(H/N\\) is a subgroup of \\(G/N\\), and every subgroup of \\(G/N\\) has this form for some \\(H\\) in \\(G\\).\n\nWhat this theorem says is that if \\(N\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) then, given a subgroup of \\(G\\) containing \\(N\\), we can produce a unique subgroup of the quotient group \\(G/N\\) and, conversely, given a subgroup of the quotient group we can produce a corresponding subgroup of \\(G\\) that contains \\(N\\).\nWe leave the proof until we have studied an illustrative example of how the Correspondence Theorem works.\n\nFirst consider the direct product group \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\).\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\oplus_{2}& (0,0) & (0,1) & (1,0) & (1,1)\\\\\n\\hline\n(0,0) & (0,0) & (0,1) & (1,0) & (1,1)  \\\\\n(0,1) & (0,1) &(0,0) & (1,1) & (1,0) \\\\\n(1,0) & (1,0) & (1,1) & (0,0) & (0,1)  \\\\\n(1,1) & (1,1) & (1,0) & (0,1) & (0,0)  \n\\end{array}\\] Subgroups of order 2 are: \\[\\begin{align*}\nH_1 &= \\{(0,0), (0,1)\\} \\\\\nH_2 &= \\{(0,0), (1,0)\\} \\\\\nH_3 &= \\{(0,0), (1,1)\\}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nExcluding the trivial group \\(\\{(0,0)\\}\\) and \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\) itself, these are all the subgroups of \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\).\n\nNow we consider the group \\(G=D_4\\) and its normal subgroup \\(N = \\{e, r_2\\}\\).\n\nThe order of \\(D_4\\) is \\(8\\) and the order of \\(N\\) is \\(2\\), therefore the order of \\(D_4/N\\) is \\(4\\). Thus, \\(D_4/N\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_4\\) or \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe subgroups of \\(D_4/N\\) are:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nX_1 &= \\{N,r_1N\\}; N \\cup r_1 N = \\{e,r_1, r_2, r_3\\} \\le D_4 \\\\\nX_2 &= \\{N, s_1N\\}; N \\cup s_1N = \\{ e, r_2, s_1, s_3\\} \\le D_4 \\\\\nX_1 &= \\{N,s_2N\\}; N \\cup s_2 N = \\{e,r_2, s_2, s_4\\} \\le D_4.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nNow we prove the theorem.\n\nTheorem 4.5 (The Correspondence Theorem) Let \\(N\\) be a normal subgroup of a finite group \\(G\\). Then \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) containing \\(N\\) if and only if \\(H/N\\) is a subgroup of \\(G/N\\), and every subgroup of \\(G/N\\) has this form for some \\(H\\) in \\(G\\).\n\n\nProof (proof of the correspondence theorem). \n\nLet \\(H\\) be a subgroup of \\(G\\) that contains \\(N\\). Notice that since \\(N\\) is normal in \\(G\\), then \\(N\\) is normal in \\(H\\). This follows as since \\(hN = Nh\\) for all \\(h \\in G\\), then \\(hN = Nh\\) for all \\(h \\in H \\le G\\). It therefore follows that \\(H/N\\) is a group, however \\(H/N \\subset G/N\\) and so \\(H/N\\) is a subgroup of \\(G/N\\).\nNow suppose \\(X\\) is a subgroup of \\(G/N\\). Let \\(\\{N, x_1N, x_2N, \\ldots, x_rN\\} \\subseteq G/N\\) be the distinct elements of \\(X\\). Define \\[H := \\bigcup_{1 \\le i \\le r} x_i N = \\{ x_i n : 1 \\le i \\le r, n \\in N\\}.\\] If \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\), then it is a subgroup of \\(G\\) that contains \\(N\\) and \\(H/N\\) is precisely the subgroup \\(X\\) of \\(G/N\\). Thus we need only show that \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\). Clearly \\(H\\) is non-empty since it contains \\(N\\). Let \\(x,z \\in  H\\). There are \\(x_i, x_j\\), \\(1 \\le i,j \\le r\\) and \\(n_1, n_2 \\in N\\) such that \\(x_i n_1 = x\\) and \\(x_jn_2 = y\\). Therefore \\[xy = x_i n_1 x_j n_2 = x_i e n_1 x_j n_2 = x_i x_j x_j^{-1}n_1 x_j n_2 = x_i x_j (x_j^{-1}n_1 x_j) n_2.\\] Since \\(N\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\), \\((x_j^{-1}n_1 x_j) \\in N\\) and so there is an \\(n\\in N\\) such that \\((x_j^{-1}n_1 x_j)n_2 = n\\). Thus, \\[xy = x_ix_j n.\\] Lastly, as \\(X\\) is a subgroup of \\(G/N\\), then there is a \\(k\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(r\\) such that \\[(x_iN)(x_jN) = (x_ix_j)N = x_kN.\\] Thus, there is an element \\(m \\in N\\) such that \\(xy = x_ix_jn = x_km\\) and so \\(xy \\in H\\). This means that \\(H\\) is closed under products.\nOne can similarly show that \\(H\\) is closed under inverses, however, as \\(H/N\\) is finite, it is enough to show closure under products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne can actually demonstrate the uniqueness of the group \\(H\\) above. For if \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) satisfy \\(H/N = H'/N\\), then for \\(x \\in H\\), there is an \\(x' \\in H'\\) such that \\(xN = x'N\\). In particular, there is an \\(m \\in N\\) such that \\(x = x'm\\) and so, as \\(N \\le H'\\), \\(x \\in H'\\). This demonstrates that \\(H \\subseteq H'\\); swapping the order of \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) above, we also have that \\(H' \\subseteq H\\). Thus, \\(H = H'\\) as required.\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.12  \n\nLet \\(G\\) be the group \\(D_4\\). Let \\(N\\) be the normal subgroup of \\(D_4\\), \\(N = \\{e, r_2\\}\\). Since \\(|D_4| = 8\\), then \\(D_4/N\\) has order \\(4\\). It follows that \\(D4/N\\) is either \\(\\Z_4\\) or \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\). However, we observe that every element of \\(D_4/N\\) has order \\(2\\). Indeed we need only check the element \\(r_1N\\): \\[ (r_1N)^2 = r_1^2 N = r_2 N = N.\\] We conclude that \\(D_4/N\\) is in fact \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\).\nNow \\(D_4/N\\) has three subgroups of order two each of which corresponds to a subgroup of order \\(4\\) in \\(D_4\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n\\text{Subgroup of } N & \\text{Corresponding subgroup of } D_4 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\{N, r_1N\\} & \\{e,r_2,r_1,r_3\\} \\\\\n\\{N, s_1N\\} & \\{e,r_2,s_1,s_3\\} \\\\\n\\{N, s_2N\\} & \\{e,r_2,s_2,s_4\\}\n\\end{array}\n\\] Thus we have all thee subgroups of \\(G\\) of order \\(4\\) each containing \\(N\\) and corresponding to exactly one of the subgroups of order \\(2\\) in \\(D_4/N\\).\n\n\n\nExample 4.13 Demonstrate the proof of the Correspondence Theorem where the quotient group is \\[(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6)/\\langle(0, 2)\\rangle.\\]\n\nWe demonstrated in Example 4.10 that \\((\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6)/\\langle(0, 2)\\rangle\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2\\).\nNon-trivial (that is not equal to the subgroups \\(\\{(0,0)\\}\\) and \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2\\)) subgroups of \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2\\) have order \\(2\\) and \\(4\\). There are \\(3\\) distinct subgroups of order \\(4\\) \\[ \\gen{(1,0)}, \\gen{((1,1))}, \\text{ and, } \\gen{(2,0), (0,1)}. \\] Each element of order \\(2\\) of \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2\\) generates a unique subgroup of order \\(2\\), there are \\(3\\) of them: \\[ \\gen{(2,0)}, \\gen{((2,1))}, \\text{ and, } \\gen{((0,1)}. \\]\nUsing Example 4.10, and setting \\(N = \\gen{(0,2)}\\), we can write down the correspondence between the subgroups of \\((\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6)/\\langle(0, 2)\\rangle\\) and \\(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n    \\text{Subgroups of order 4 }  & \\text{Corresponding subgroup of } \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6  \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\{N, (1,0)N,(2,0)N, (3,0)N\\} & \\{e,(0,2),(0,4),(1,0),(1,2),(1,4),\\\\\n    &(2,0),(2,2),(2,4),(3,0),(3,2),(3,4)\\} \\\\\n    &  \\\\\n    \\{N, (1,1)N,(2,0)N,(3,1)N\\} & \\{e,(0,2),(0,4),(1,1),(1,3),(1,5),\\\\\n    &  (2,0),(2,2),(2,4),(3,1),(3,3),(3,5)\\} \\\\\n    &  \\\\\n    \\{N, (0,1)N, (2,1)N, (2,0)N\\} & \\{e,(0,2),(0,4),(0,1),(0,3),(0,5),\\\\ &(2,1),(2,3),(2,5),(2,0),(2,2),(2,4)\\}  \n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n\\text{Subgroups of order 2 }  & \\text{Corresponding subgroup of } \\Z_4 \\times \\Z_6  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\{N, (0,1)N\\} & \\{e,(0,2),(0,4),(0,1),(0,3),(0,5)\\} \\\\\n\\{N, (2,0)N\\} & \\{e,(0,2),(0,4),(2,0),(2,2),(2,4)\\} \\\\\n\\{N,(2,1)N\\} & \\{e,(0,2),(0,4),(2,1),(2,3),(2,5)\\}  \n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\nExample 4.14  \n\nLet \\(G\\) be a group of order \\(44\\). Suppose \\(G\\) has a normal subgroup \\(N\\) of order \\(11\\), so that \\(G/N\\) is a group of order \\(4\\). Thus \\(G/N\\) is isomorphic either to \\(\\Z_4\\) or \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\). Now both \\(\\Z_4\\) and \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\) have subgroups of order \\(2\\) and so \\(G\\) has a subgroup \\(H\\) containing \\(N\\) such that \\(H/N\\) has order \\(2\\). This means that \\(H\\) has order \\(22\\) and so must itself be a normal subgroup of \\(G\\). Thus \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) containing \\(N\\).",

    "text": "4.4 Normalisers\nWe now consider a question which may seem artificial, but will turn out to be very important.\n\nGiven a subgroup, \\(H\\), of a group \\(G\\), what is the largest subgroup of \\(G\\) containing \\(H\\) as a normal subgroup?\n\n\nConsider the group \\(H = \\{e,r_2\\} \\norm D_4\\). The largest subgroup of \\(D_4\\) in which \\(H\\) is normal, is \\(D_4\\) itself.\nNow \\(\\{e,s_1\\}\\) is not a normal subgroup of \\(D_4\\), but \\(\\{e, r_2, s_1,s_3\\}\\) is a subgroup of \\(D_4\\) in which \\(\\{e, s_1\\}\\) is normal. Notice that the elements \\(g \\in D_4\\) such that \\(g\\{e,s_1\\} = \\{e,s_1\\}g\\) are precisely \\(e,r_2, s_1\\) and \\(s_3\\).\n\nWe had better make sure that this is a sensible question! If \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\), then the answer is \\(G\\). If \\(H\\) is not normal in \\(G\\) can we be certain that there is a subgroup of \\(G\\) that contains \\(H\\) as a normal subgroup? Yes! Any group is a normal subgroup of itself so \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) containing \\(H\\) as a normal subgroup. Having established the existence of such a subgroup it makes sense to ask for the largest such subgroup (except that there may be more than one). Let \\(L\\) be a largest subgroup of \\(G\\) containing \\(H\\) as a normal subgroup. It is certainly the case that any element \\(l\\in L\\) has the property that \\(lH=Hl\\). It would be nice if every element \\(g\\in G\\) with the property that \\(gH=Hg\\) formed a subgroup of \\(G\\), then this subgroup would certainly answer our question. We first define this set, then prove that it is a subgroup.\n\nDefinition 4.3 (Normaliser) Let \\(H\\) be a subgroup of a group \\(G\\). The normaliser of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\) is denoted and defined by \\[N(H)=\\{g\\in G| gH=Hg\\}.\\]\n\n\nTheorem 4.6 Let \\(H\\) be a subgroup of a group \\(G\\), then the normaliser of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\) forms a subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nWe prove this both directly, in the normal way, and indirectly using a group action.\n\nDirect proof: Clearly \\(e \\in N(H)\\) since \\(eH = H = He\\). Let \\(g_1, g_2 \\in N(H)\\). Then \\[g_1g_2H = g_1 (g_2H) = g_1(Hg_2) = (g_1H)g_2 = H(g_1g_2)\\] and so \\(g_1g_2 \\in N(H)\\). Let \\(g \\in N(H)\\) and consider \\(g h_1\\) for \\(h_1 \\in H\\). There is and \\(h_2 \\in H\\) such that \\(g h_1 = h_2 g\\). Taking inverses of both sides \\[h_1^{-1}g^{-1} = (gh_1)^{-1} = (h_2g)^{-1} = g^{-1}h_2^{-1}.\\] We conclude that \\(g^{-1}H = Hg^{-1}\\).\nIndirect proof:\nWe define an action \\(\\ast\\) of \\(G\\) on the set of all of the subsets of \\(G\\). In terms of the definition of a group action (see Definition 3.1) this set is the set denoted \\(X\\) and we need to demonstrate that all three conditions hold. Clearly for \\(S \\subseteq G\\), \\(gS \\ginv\\) is again a subset of \\(G\\). Thus \\(g \\ast S \\in X\\) for all \\(S \\in X\\) and \\(g \\in G\\). Moreover,\n\n\\(e \\ast S = e S e^{-1} = e S e = S\\) for all \\(S \\in X\\);\n\\(g_1 \\ast (g_2 \\ast S = g_1 \\ast (g_2 S g_2^{-1}) = g_1g_2 S g_2^{-1}g_1^{-1} = g_1g_2 S (g_1g_2)^{-1} = (g_1g_2) \\ast S\\). So \\(\\ast\\) is indeed an action of \\(G\\) on the set of all subsets of \\(G\\). We know that the stabiliser of an element of \\(X\\) under the action is a subgroup of \\(G\\). However, the stabiliser of a subgroup under this particular action, is just the normaliser of the subgroup yielding the result.",

But \\(\\Z_6\\) is not in the form given by the FTFAG as 6 is not the power of a prime. So the given group is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\) (which is, of course, isomorphic to \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\)). You should check that this follows from Theorem 5.3. An isomorphism from \\((\\Z_3 \\times \\Z_6) / \\langle (1, 0) \\rangle\\) to \\(\\Z_6\\) is easy (just map \\((x, y) + \\langle (1, 0) \\rangle\\) to \\(y\\) ), but we need a mapping from \\((\\Z_3 \\times \\Z_6) / \\langle (1, 0) \\rangle\\) to \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_3\\). Since both groups are cyclic we just map a generator in one group to a generator in another, for example: \\[\\begin{equation*}\n  (0, 1) + \\langle (1, 0) \\rangle \\mapsto (1, 1).\n  \\end{equation*}\\] It then follows that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  (0, 2) + \\langle (1, 0) \\rangle &\\mapsto (0, 2)\\\\\n  (0, 3) + \\langle (1, 0) \\rangle &\\mapsto (1, 0)\\\\\n  (0, 4) + \\langle (1, 0) \\rangle &\\mapsto (0, 1)\\\\\n  (0, 5) + \\langle (1, 0) \\rangle &\\mapsto (1, 2)\\\\\n  (0, 6) + \\langle (1, 0) \\rangle &\\mapsto (0, 0) \\qquad \\text{as expected!}\n  \\end{align*}\\]\nThis one is not so obvious, so we need to kick it around a bit. \\[\\langle (1, 2) \\rangle = \\{(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6) \\} = H.\\] Now we can see that \\((0, 1) + H\\) has order 8 (because the first multiple of \\((0, 1)\\) in \\(H\\) is \\((0, 0)\\)) and since \\((\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_8) / \\langle (1, 2) \\rangle\\) has order 8 it must be isomorphic to \\(\\Z_8\\). An isomorphism is given by \\[(x, y) + H \\mapsto y.\\] Note that this is in the correct form for the FTFAG as 8 is a power of a prime.\nAgain, this is not obvious, so let \\[H = \\langle (2, 2) \\rangle  = \\{ (0, 0), (2, 2), (0, 4), (2, 6) \\}.\\] Hence, \\((\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_8) / \\langle (2, 2) \\rangle\\) has order 8. This time \\((0, 1) + H\\) has order 4 (make sure you understand why). This rules out \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\), but still leaves \\(\\Z_8\\) and \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4\\) as possibilities. We could list the order of each of the elements, or look for elements of order 8, or for more than one element of order 2 (because cyclic groups of even order have exactly one element of order 2). You should beware of falling into the following trap. It may be tempting to say that, since \\((0, 2)+H\\) and \\((2, 0)+H\\) both have order 2, the group is isomorphic to \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_4\\).

Let \\(g_1, g_2 \\in gH\\ginv\\). So, there exist \\(h_1, h_2 \\in H\\) such that \\(g_1 = gh_1\\ginv\\) and \\(g_2 = gh_2\\ginv\\). Then \\[g_1g_2 = (gh_1\\ginv)(gh_2\\ginv) = gh_1h_2\\ginv \\in gH\\ginv\\] (because \\(h_1h_2 \\in H\\) as \\(H\\) is a subgroup).

The centre of \\(G\\) is denoted and defined by \\[Z(G) = \\{ z \\in G \\, | \\, zg = gz \\; \\forall \\, g \\in G \\}.\\] The of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\) is denoted and defined by \\[N(H) = \\{ g \\in G \\, | \\, gH = Hg \\}.\\] Now we know that \\(N(H)\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) and we also know that \\(Z(G)\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\). So, if we can show that \\(Z(G) \\subseteq N(H)\\), then it follows that \\(Z(G)\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(N(H)\\). Now, let \\(x \\in Z(G)\\). Then, \\[\\begin{align*}\n& xg = gx \\qquad \\forall \\, g \\in G\\\\\n\\imp & xh = hx \\qquad \\forall \\, h \\in H \\qquad \\text{(as $h \\in G$ also)}\\\\\n\\imp & xH = Hx\\\\\n\\imp & x \\in N(H).\n\\end{align*}\\] Hence \\(Z(G) \\subseteq N(H)\\), as required. (Note that \\(Z(G)\\) must be normal in \\(N(H)\\) else it would not be normal in \\(G\\).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4.4\n\n\nLet \\(n \\ge 3\\). Show that the centre of \\(S_n\\) is trivial.

There is a point \\(x \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots, n\\}\\) such that \\(g(x) = y \\ne x\\). Let \\(z \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots, n\\}\\backslash\\{x,y\\}\\). Notice that \\(z\\) exists since \\(n \\ge 3\\).\nConsider \\(g(x\\ y \\ z)g^{-1}\\). Since \\(g \\in Z(S_n)\\), then \\(g(x \\ y \\ z)g^{-1} = (x \\ y \\ z)\\). We compute \\[g(x \\ y \\ z)g^{-1} = (g(x) \\ g(y) \\ g(z)) = (y \\ g(y) \\ g(z)) = (x \\ y \\ z).\\] It follows that \\(g(y) = z\\) and \\(g(z) = x\\).\nNow consider the two cycle \\((x \\ y)\\). We must also have \\(g(x \\ y)g^{-1} = (x \\ y)\\). However, from above, \\(g(x \\ y)g^{-1} = (y z) \\ne (x \\ y)\\) (since \\(z \\ne x\\)). This yields the desired contradiction. We conclude that \\(Z(S_n)\\) contains only the identity permutation.\nThe group \\(S_2\\) is isomorphic to \\(Z_2\\) and so is abelian and equal to its own centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4.5\n\n\nLet \\(N\\) be a normal subgroup of a finite group \\(G\\), and \\(H\\) be a further subgroup of \\(G\\) (which need not be normal in \\(G\\)).

Then, \\[\\begin{align*}\n(n_1h_1)(n_2h_2) &= n_1(h_1n_2)h_2 \\qquad \\text{(associativity)}\\\\\n&= n_1(n_3h_1)h_2 \\qquad \\text{(for some} \\; n_3 \\in N \\; \\text{because} \\; h_1N = Nh_1)\\\\\n&= (n_1n_3)(h_1h_2) \\; \\in NH \\qquad \\text{(as} \\; n_1n_3 \\in N \\; \\text{and} \\; h_1h_2 \\in H).\n\\end{align*}\\] Hence \\(NH\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4.6\n\n\nIn \\(D_4\\), let \\(e\\) and \\(r_2\\) denote the identity and \\(\\pi\\) radians rotation respectively. Given that \\(N = \\{e, r_2\\}\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(D_4\\), give an example of a surjective homomorphism \\[\\phi : D_4 \\maps D_4 / N\\] and classify \\(D_4 / N\\) according to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 4.6\n\n\n\n\nSolution 4.6\n\n\nNote that \\(|D_4| = 8\\) and \\(|N| = 2\\), so \\(|D_4 / N| = 4\\). Hence it follows (from the Fundamental Theorem) that either \\(D_4/N \\cong \\Z_4\\) or \\(D_4/N \\cong \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\). The elements of \\(D_4/N\\) are: \\[\\begin{align*}\nN = r_2N &= \\{e, r_2\\}\\\\\nr_1N = r_3N &= \\{r_1, r_3 \\}\\\\\ns_1N = s_3N &= \\{s_1, s_3 \\}\\\\\ns_2N = s_4N &= \\{s_2, s_4 \\}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Clearly \\((s_1N)^2 = (s_2N)^2 = N\\) and \\((r_1N)^2 = r_2N = N\\), so all non-identity elements have order 2. Hence \\(D_4/N \\cong \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\). A surjective homomorphism \\(\\phi : D_4 \\maps D_4 / N\\) is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\phi(e) = \\phi(r_2) &= N\\\\\n\\phi(r_1) = \\phi(r_3) &= r_1N\\\\\n\\phi(s_1) = \\phi(s_3) &= s_1N\\\\\n\\phi(s_2) = \\phi(s_4) &= s_2N.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4.7\n\n\nConsider the quarternion group \\(Q_8\\) with elements \\(\\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}\\) and multiplication defined by the rules: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n(-1)^2 = 1,& \\\\\ni^2 = j^2 = k^2= -1,&\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] and \\[ij=k = -(ji), jk =i=-(kj), ki= j = -(ik).\\]\nThe group \\(N = \\{1, -1\\}\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(Q_8\\).

We begin with a definition.\nThe kernel of a homomorphism consists, therefore, of all of the elements of \\(G\\) that are mapped onto the identity in \\(\\gp\\).\nSince \\(ker(\\phi)\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\), it follows that we can form the quotient group of \\(G\\) by \\(ker(\\phi)\\). The following result tells us that this quotient group is isomorphic to the image of \\(G\\) under the homomorphism; this is known as the First Isomorphism Theorem (there are two more but we will not need them).\nThe converse of the First Isomorphism Theorem is also true, namely if \\(N\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) then we can easily define a group homomorphism \\(\\phi : G \\rightarrow \\gp\\) such that \\(G/N \\cong \\phi (G)\\). The exact nature of the group \\(\\gp\\) is not important and there are infinitely many groups \\(\\gp\\) that we could choose to serve our purpose (any group containing a subgroup isomorphic to \\(G/N\\) will do), but the easiest one to choose is \\(\\gp = G/N\\).\nThe map \\(\\phi\\) in the statement of Lemma 5.3 is called the natural or canonical homomorphism.\nIn summary, the image of a homomorphism of \\(G\\) is isomorphic to \\(G/N\\) where \\(N\\) is the kernel of the homomorphism, and for every normal subgroup \\(N\\) of \\(G\\) there is a homomorphism from \\(G\\) to \\(G/N\\) with kernel \\(N\\) (each homomorphism has a different codomain as \\(N\\) changes). Group homomorphisms and quotient groups are really just two different ways of looking at the same thing. Compare the following example and theorem to those in Chapter 4.\nIn very loose terms the previous example can be represented as follows: \\[(\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2) / \\langle (0, 1) \\rangle = \\frac{\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2}{\\{0\\} \\times \\Z_2} = \\Z_4.\\]",

Then \\(ker(\\phi)\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nFirst we need to demonstrate that \\(ker(\\phi)\\) is a subgroup. Clearly, the \\(ker(\\phi)\\) is non-empty since it contains the identity of \\(G\\).\nLet \\(g,h \\in ker(\\phi)\\).

We need to prove that: + that \\(\\psi\\) is a well-defined map; + that \\(\\psi\\) is a bijection; + that \\(\\psi\\) is a homomorphism.\nFirst we prove that \\(\\psi\\) is well-defined. Let \\(g,h \\in G\\) such that \\(\\phi(g) = \\phi(h)\\). We need to show that \\(\\psi(\\phi(g)) = \\psi(\\phi(h))\\). Since \\(\\phi(g)= \\phi(h)\\) then \\(\\phi(g h^{-1}) = \\phi(g)\\phi(h)^{-1} = e'\\), where \\('e\\) is the identity element of \\(\\gp\\). Therefore, \\(gh^{-1} \\in K\\). Let \\(k \\in K\\) be such that \\(gh^{-1} = k\\). Then, by postmultiplying on both sides by \\(h\\), we have \\(g = kh\\). We now have, \\[\\phi(g) = \\phi(kh) = \\phi(k)\\phi(h) = e' \\phi(h) = \\phi(h)\\] and \\(\\phi(g) = \\phi(h)\\) as required.\nClearly the map \\(\\psi\\) is surjective since for any \\(gK \\in G/K\\) \\(\\psi(\\phi(g)) = gK\\). Thus it remains only to show that \\(\\psi\\) is a injective to conclude that it is bijective.\nSuppose \\(\\phi(g), \\phi(h) \\in \\phi(G)\\) satisfy \\(gK = hK\\). We want to conclude that \\(\\phi(g) = \\phi(h)\\). Since \\(gK = hK\\), then \\(gh^{-1} \\in K\\). Therefore there is a \\(k \\in K\\) such that \\(g = hk\\) (repeating an argument above). Repeating the argument for well-definedness, we conclude that \\(\\phi(g)= \\phi(h)\\) as required.\nThe last is the most straightforward. We verify the homomorphism criteria: \\[\\psi(\\phi(g)\\phi(h)) = \\psi(\\phi(gh)) = ghK = gK hK = \\psi(\\phi(g))\\psi(\\phi(h))\\] as required.\n\n\n\n\nLemma 5.3 Let \\(N\\) be a normal subgroup of \\(G\\). Then \\(\\phi : G \\rightarrow G/N\\) defined by \\(\\phi(x) = xN\\), for all \\(x \\in G\\), is a homomorphism with kernel \\(N\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nThe map \\(\\phi\\) is a homomorphism since \\[\\phi(xy) = (xy)N = xN yN = \\phi(x)\\phi(y).\\]\nClear \\(N \\subseteq \\ker(\\phi)\\). On the other hand, if \\(x \\in \\ker(\\phi)\\) then \\(xN = N\\) and so \\(x \\in N\\). Thus \\(\\ker(\\phi) = N\\) as required.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.11 Classify the group \\((\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2) / \\langle (0, 1) \\rangle\\) according to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.\n\nThe map \\(\\phi:\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2 \\to  \\Z_4\\) defined by \\(\\phi((x,y)) = x\\) is a homomorphism with kernel \\[\\{0\\} \\times \\Z_2 = \\{(0,0),(0,1)\\}.\\] Therefore, using the First Isomorphism Theorem, \\((\\Z_4 \\times \\Z_2) / \\langle (0, 1) \\rangle \\cong \\Z_4\\).\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 5.3 Let \\(G = H \\times K\\) be the direct product of groups \\(H\\) and \\(K\\).

    "section": "5.2 Homomorphisms and Group Actions",
    "text": "5.2 Homomorphisms and Group Actions\nWhen introducing group actions we made the following remark:\n\nGroups acting on sets are really just thinly disguised permutation groups in that whenever a group \\(G\\) acts on a set \\(X\\) we can associate with each \\(g\\in G\\) the permutation \\(f_g\\) of \\(X\\) defined by \\(f_g(x)=g*x,\\ \\forall \\, x\\in X\\). These permutations form a subgroup of \\(S_{|X|}\\), but this group need not be isomorphic to \\(G\\), and we shall return to this later.\n\nWe are now in a position to state precisely what was meant by this, and we begin with the following theorem (note that, as usual, we denote the action of a group element \\(g\\) on an element \\(x \\in X\\) by \\(g * x\\)):\n\nTheorem 5.4 Let \\(G\\) be a group acting on a finite set \\(X\\). Define \\(\\phi : G \\rightarrow S_{|X|}\\) by \\(\\phi(g) = f_g\\) where \\(f_g(x) = g*x\\) for all \\(x \\in X\\). Then \\(\\phi\\) is a homomorphism.\n\n\nProof. \n\nWe need to show that the map \\(\\phi\\) is well-defined. In this context, this means verifying that \\(f_g\\) is in fact a bijection on \\(X\\). A map is bijective if and only if it is invertible and so it suffices to show that \\(f_g\\) is invertible. We have: \\[(f_g \\circ f_{g^{-1}})(x) = f_g(f_{g^{-1}}(x)) = f_g(g^{-1}\\ast x) = g \\ast(g^{-1}\\ast x) = e\\ast x = x.\\] Similarly one has that \\(f_{\\ginv} \\circ f_{g}(x) =x\\) for all \\(x \\in X\\). Therefore \\(f_g\\) is invertible (with inverse \\(f_{\\ginv}\\)) and so it is a bijective map on \\(X\\).\nIt now remains to verify that \\(\\phi\\) is a homomorphism. We have \\[\\phi(gh)(x) = f_{gh}(x) = (gh)\\ast x = g\\ast(h \\ast x) =f_g(f_h(x)) = \\phi(g)(\\phi(h)(x))\\] for all \\(x \\in X\\). This means that \\(\\phi(gh)= \\phi(g)\\phi(h)\\) and so \\(\\phi\\) is a homomorphism.\n\n\n\nRemark. The kernel of the homomorphism in Theorem 5.4 is precisely the set of elements \\(g \\in G\\) with \\(\\fix(g) = X\\).\n\n\nExample 5.12  \n\nRecall that in Chapter 3, Example 3.5 we considered the group \\(D_4\\) acting on the diagonals \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\) of the square.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe demonstrated that the permutation group corresponding to this action is: \\[\n  \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} d_1 & d_2 \\\\ d_1 & d_2 \\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix} d_1 & d_2 \\\\ d_2 & d_1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\} \\cong S_2.\n\\]\nBy Theorem 5.4, \\(\\phi: D_4 \\to S_2\\) is defined by: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\phi(e)&= \\phi(r_2)=\\phi(s_2) = \\phi(s_4) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n\\phi(r_1)&= \\phi(r_3)=\\phi(s_1) = \\phi(s_3) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\\] is a homomorphism with kernel \\(K = \\{ e,r_2, s_2, s_4\\}\\).

As these two groups are isomorphic it follows that they must have the same order and so \\[| \\, \\phi(G) \\, | = | \\, G/K \\, | = \\frac{| \\, G \\, |}{| \\, K \\, |}\\] and hence \\(| \\, K \\, | = \\D \\frac{| \\, G \\, |}{| \\, \\phi(G) \\, |}\\).

Consider the mapping \\(\\phi : \\Z_2 \\rightarrow \\Z_2 \\times D_3\\) defined by \\(\\phi(0) = (0, e)\\) and \\(\\phi(1) = (1, e)\\). This is a homomorphism since \\[\\phi(0 + 1) = \\phi(1) = (1, e) = (0, e)(1, e) = \\phi(0) \\phi(1),\\] and whilst \\(\\Z_2\\) is abelian, \\(\\Z_2 \\times D_3\\) is not abelian.\nThis statement is . Consider the mapping \\(\\phi : D_3 \\rightarrow \\Z_2\\) defined by \\(\\phi(e) = \\phi(r_1) = \\phi(r_2) = 0\\) and \\(\\phi(s_i) = 1\\) for all \\(i = 1, 2, 3\\). Clearly this is a homomorphism (convince yourselves) and whilst \\(\\Z_2\\) is abelian, \\(D_3\\) is non-abelian.\nThis statement is . Let \\(\\phi(x), \\phi(y) \\in \\phi(G)\\). Then, \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\phi(x)\\phi(y) &= \\phi(xy) \\qquad \\qquad \\text{(homomorphism)} \\\\\n  &= \\phi(yx) \\qquad \\qquad \\text{($G$ is abelian)} \\\\\n  &= \\phi(y)\\phi(x),\n  \\end{align*}\\] so \\(\\phi(G)\\) is abelian.\nThis statement is . The counter example in part (b) above will suffice. (If you want a non-surjective homomorphism then you could have \\(\\phi : D_3 \\rightarrow \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\) defined by \\(\\phi(e) = \\phi(r_1) = \\phi(r_2) = (0,0)\\) and \\(\\phi(s_i) = (1,0)\\) for all \\(i = 1, 2, 3\\).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5.4\n\n\nBy considering all of the normal subgroups of \\(D_4\\), determine the number of distinct homomorphisms that exist from \\(D_4\\) to \\(A_4\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 5.4\n\n\n\n\nSolution 5.4\n\n\nThe first thing to note is that as the kernel of a homomorphism mapping from \\(G\\) to \\(\\gp\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) and, therefore, in this example, must be one of the normal subgroups of \\(D_4\\). There are six normal subgroups of \\(D_4\\) which are \\(D_4\\), \\(\\{e\\}\\), \\(\\{e, r_2\\}\\), \\(\\{e, r_1, r_2, r_3\\}\\), \\(\\{e, r_2, s_1, s_3\\}\\), and \\(\\{e, r_2, s_2, s_4\\}\\). If \\(\\phi : D_4 \\rightarrow A_4\\) is a homomorphism, then \\(K = \\text{ker}\\, (\\phi)\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(D_4\\) and \\(\\phi(D_4)\\) is a subgroup of \\(A_4\\) (Theorem 5.1), with \\[|K| \\times | \\phi(D_4)| = 8.\\] (This follows from the First Isomorphism Theorem; as \\(\\phi(G) \\cong G/K\\) then the sizes of these two groups must be the same, so \\(|K| \\times |\\phi(G)| = |G|\\).) Clearly, \\(K \\neq \\{e\\}\\) since \\(A_4\\) has no subgroup of order 8 (\\(|A_4| = 12\\)). If \\(K=D_4\\), his implies that \\(\\phi\\) is the trivial homomorphism. If \\(|K|=4\\) then \\(|\\phi(D_4)|=2\\), so \\(\\phi(D_4) = \\{ \\,\\text{id}, (1 \\; 2)(3\\; 4 )\\}\\), \\(\\{ \\,\\text{id}, (1 \\; 3)(2\\; 4 )\\}\\), or \\(\\{ \\,\\text{id}, (1 \\; 4)(2\\; 3 )\\}\\), giving three homomorphisms for each of the three possible choices of \\(K\\) (there are three normal subgroups of \\(D_4\\) of order 4). Hence, there are 9 distinct homomorphisms of this type. If \\(|K|=2\\) then \\(K=\\{e, r_2\\}\\) and \\[D_4/K = \\{ \\{e, r_2\\}, \\{r_1, r_3\\}, \\{s_1, s_3\\}, \\{s_2, s_4\\}\\},\\] which has order 4. So \\(D_4/K \\cong \\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\) as each non-identity element in \\(D_4/K\\) has order 2. Hence, \\(\\phi(D_4)=\\{ \\,\\text{id}, (1 \\; 2)(3\\; 4 ), (1 \\; 3)(2 \\; 4), (1 \\; 4)(2 \\; 3)\\}\\) by the First Isomorphism Theorem. We know that \\(\\phi(e) = \\phi(r_2) = \\, \\text{id}\\), \\(\\phi(r_1) = \\phi(r_3)\\), \\(\\phi(s_1) = \\phi(s_3)\\), and \\(\\phi(s_2) = \\phi(s_4)\\). There are no further restrictions, so there are 6 homomorphisms of this type. Hence the total number of homomorphisms is \\(1+9+6 = 16\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5.5\n\n\nLet \\(G,H,K\\) be groups.\n\nIf \\(\\phi:G \\to H\\) is a homomorphism and \\(\\psi: H \\to K\\) is a homomorphism, show that \\(\\psi\\phi: G \\to K\\).\nIf \\(\\phi: G \\to H\\) is an isomorphism, show that \\(\\phi^{-1}: H \\to G\\) is also an isomorphism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 5.5\n\n\n\n\nSolution 5.5\n\n\n\nLet \\(x,y \\in G\\). Then \\[\\psi\\phi(xy) = \\psi(\\phi(xy))= \\psi(\\phi(x)\\phi(y)) = \\psi(\\phi(x))\\psi(\\phi(y)) = \\psi\\phi(x)\\psi\\phi(y)\\] as required.\nClearly \\(\\phi^{-1}\\) is also a bijection. Therefore it remains to show that \\(\\phi^{-1}\\) is a homomorphism. Let \\(s,t \\in H\\). There are \\(x,y \\in G\\) such that \\(\\phi(x)= s\\) and \\(\\phi(y) = t\\). We have \\[\\phi^{-1}(st) = \\phi^{-1}(\\phi(x)\\phi(y)) = \\phi^{-1}(\\phi(xy)) = xy = \\phi^{-1}(s)\\phi^{-1}(t)\\] as required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5.6\n\n\nLet \\(G\\) be a group and fix an element \\(g \\in G\\). Define a mapping \\(\\kappa_g: G \\to G\\) by \\(\\kappa_g(h) = ghg^{-1}\\) for all \\(h \\in G\\). Show that \\(\\kappa_g\\) is an isomorphism from \\(G\\) to \\(G\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 5.6\n\n\n\n\nSolution 5.6\n\n\nFirst we show that \\(\\kappa_g\\) is invertible (and so a bijection). Define \\(\\kappa_{g^{-1}}: G \\to G\\) by \\(\\kappa_{g^{-1}}(h) = g^{-1}hg\\) for all \\(h \\in G\\). Observe that for any \\(h \\in G\\),\n\\[\\kappa_{g}\\kappa_{g^{-1}}(h) = \\kappa_g(g^{-1}hg) = g(g^{-1}hg)g^{-1} = h.\\] Similarly, \\(\\kappa_{g^{-1}}\\kappa_{g}(h)=h\\) for all \\(h \\in G\\).\nIt follows that \\(\\kappa_{g^{-1}} = \\kappa_{g}^{-1}\\). Therefore, \\(\\kappa_{g}\\) is invertible and so a bijection.\nNow we show that \\(\\kappa_{g}\\) is a homomorphism.\nLet \\(h,k \\in G\\), then, \\[\\kappa_{g}(hk) = ghkg^{-1} = gh(g^{-1}g)kg^{-1} = (ghg^{-1})(gkg^{-1}) = \\kappa_{g}(h)\\kappa_{g}(k)\\] as required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5.7\n\n\nWrite down a non-trivial homomorphism from \\(A_4\\) to \\(D_3\\) and describe its kernel, \\(K\\). Form the quotient group \\(A_4/K\\) and show directly that this is isomorphic to the image of \\(A_4\\). (This is a bit tricky; remember that the image of \\(A_4\\) need not be the whole of \\(D_3\\), but must be a non-trivial subgroup of \\(D_3\\).)\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Solution 5.7\n\n\n\n\nSolution 5.7\n\n\nIf \\(\\phi : A_4 \\rightarrow D_3\\) is a homomorphism, then \\(\\phi(A_4)\\) is a subgroup of \\(D_3\\) isomorphic to \\(A_4/K\\) (First Isomorphism Theorem). Now, \\(|A_4| = 12\\) so, by Lagrange’s Theorem, we know that \\(|K| = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6\\) or \\(12\\). \\(|K| = 1 \\imp | \\, A_4/K \\, | = 12\\) and \\(|K| = 3 \\imp | \\, A_4/K \\, | = 4\\), but neither of these are possible since \\(D_3\\) does not have subgroups of orders 12 or 4 (as \\(|D_3| = 6\\)). \\(|K| = 12 \\imp | \\, A_4/K \\, | = 1\\), so \\(\\phi\\) is trivial. \\(|K| \\neq 6\\) since \\(A_4\\) has no subgroup of order 6. Now, \\(A_4\\) has eight elements of order 3 and three of order 2 (cyclic structures \\((* \\; * \\; *)\\) and \\((* \\; *)(* \\; *)\\) respectively - see Problem Sheet 3 Q4). By part 1(c) above, the elements of order 3 must map to the identity or one of the rotations in \\(D_3\\) and, similarly, the elements of order 2 must map onto the identity or a reflection. Now, if \\(|K| = 2\\) then \\(A_4/K \\cong D_3\\) but this is not possible since \\(A_4 / K\\) only has two elements of order 2 whereas \\(D_3\\) has three elements (each of the reflections) of order 2. We now consider why this is so. Any subgroup of order 2 in \\(A_4\\) must contain the identity and one element of order 2. So, there are only three possible subgroups of \\(A_4\\) of order 2, namely \\(\\{id, (1 \\; 2)(3 \\; 4) \\}, \\{id, (1 \\; 3)(2 \\; 4) \\}\\) and \\(\\{id, (1 \\; 4)(2 \\; 3) \\}\\). Now, a coset, \\(\\sigma K\\) from \\(A_4/K\\) has order 2 if and only if \\(\\sigma \\notin K\\) (if it were then \\(\\sigma K = K\\) and that has order 1 in \\(A_4/k\\)), and \\(\\sigma ^2 \\in K\\). We illustrate this last point by example. Suppose that \\(K = \\{ id, (1 \\; 2)(3 \\; 4)\\}\\), how can we form a \\(\\sigma K\\) of order 2 in \\(A_4/K\\)? Well, \\((1 \\; 3)(2 \\; 4)K = (1 \\; 4)(2 \\; 3)K\\) and this coset has period 2, but there are no others. Also, any other coset \\(\\sigma K\\) such that \\(\\sigma = (* \\; * \\; *)\\) does not have order 2 since \\(\\sigma ^2 \\neq \\text{id}\\) nor is \\(\\sigma ^2 \\in K\\). So, there is exactly one element of period 2 in \\(A_4/K\\), and so \\(A_4/K \\ncong D_3\\). If \\(|K| = 4\\) then \\(|A_4/K| = 3\\) and hence \\(A_4/K \\cong \\{e, r_1, r_2 \\}\\). Now, \\(K = \\{ e, (1 \\; 2)(3 \\; 4), (1 \\; 3)(2 \\; 4), (1 \\; 4)(2 \\; 3)\\}\\) and \\(A_4/K = \\{K, (1 \\; 2 \\: 3)K, (1 \\; 2 \\; 4)K \\}\\). We now define a homomorphism \\(\\phi : A_4 \\rightarrow D_3\\) by: \\(\\phi(e) = \\phi((1 \\; 2)(3 \\; 4)) = \\phi((1 \\; 3)(2 \\; 4)) = \\phi((1 \\; 4)(2 \\; 3)) = e\\) \\(\\phi(\\sigma) = r_1 \\quad \\forall \\, \\sigma \\in (1 \\; 2 \\; 3)K = \\{(1 \\; 2 \\; 3), (1 \\; 3 \\; 4), (2 \\; 4 \\; 3), (1 \\; 4 \\; 2) \\}\\) \\(\\phi(\\sigma) = r_2 \\quad \\forall \\, \\sigma \\in (1 \\; 2 \\; 4)K = \\{(1 \\; 2 \\; 4), (1 \\; 4 \\; 3), (1 \\; 3 \\; 2), (2 \\; 3 \\; 4) \\}\\) This then forces the isomorphism (see the proof to the First Isomorphism Theorem) \\(\\mu : A_4/K \\rightarrow \\phi (D_3)\\) (where \\(\\phi (D_3) = \\{e, r_1, r_2 \\}\\)) defined by \\(\\mu (aK) \\rightarrow \\phi(a)\\).",

    "text": "6.1 Conjugates, Centralisers and the Class Equation\nWe begin with a definition:\nAt this point the traditional approach would be to show that conjugacy defines an equivalence relation on the elements of \\(G\\) and that the size of each equivalence class divides the order of \\(G\\). All of this will follow from the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem once we have established the following:\nIf we have established a group action then we know that we must have orbits and stabilisers. The orbits of the above group action are called the conjugacy classes of \\(G\\), and we denote the conjugacy class containing \\(x\\) by \\(conj_G (x)\\), that is \\[conj_G(x) = \\{ gxg^{-1} \\, | \\, g \\in G \\}.\\]\nThe Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem tells us that the order of each conjugacy class divides the order of the group. We also observe that an element \\(x\\) belongs to a conjugacy class of size 1 if and only if \\(gxg^{-1} = x, \\; \\forall \\, g \\in G\\) (or, equivalently, if and only if \\(x\\) is in the centre of \\(G\\), as \\(xg=gx \\ifif x = gxg^{-1}\\)). As the conjugacy classes partition \\(G\\) it is a trivial observation to note that the sum of the sizes of the distinct conjugacy classes of \\(G\\) equals the order of \\(G\\). This and the preceding remarks form the basis of the so-called Class Equation of \\(G\\). First we state those observations formally. If \\(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_r\\) are the distinct conjugacy classes of a finite group \\(G\\), then it follows that \\[|G| = \\sum_{i=1}^r  |C_i|.\\] Suppose we now order those conjugacy classes such that \\(C_1\\) is the conjugacy class containing the identity (which has size 1) and that \\(C_2, \\ldots, C_t, C_{t+1}, \\ldots, C_r\\) are the remaining classes, but where \\(C_2, \\ldots, C_t\\) are the trivial classes containing only one element. From what we have said previously we know that \\[|Z(G)| = \\sum_{i=1}^t  |C_i|,\\] that is, the size of the centre is equal to the sum of all of the conjugacy classes of size 1 since each element in those classes must be in the centre. This then leads us to the formal definition:\nIn this equation, the summation is the sum of the sizes of all of the non-trivial conjugacy classes. An important property of the Class Equation is that each of the terms on the right hand side is a divisor of the order of \\(G\\). This follows since \\(Z(G)\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\), so the size of \\(Z(G)\\) must divide the order of \\(G\\) and the size of each summand (being an orbit of the action) also divides the order of \\(G\\).",

    "text": "6.2 Finite \\(p\\)-Groups\nBefore proceeding with our development of the Sylow Theorems we pause to consider the structure of finite \\(p\\)-groups (that is, finite groups in which the order of every element is a power of a prime \\(p\\) (definition) or, equivalently, groups of order \\(p^r\\) for some prime \\(p\\) - see Theorem 3.6). We know that groups of order a prime \\(p\\) are cyclic (and hence abelian). We will soon show that groups of order \\(p^2\\) are abelian and, therefore, isomorphic to either \\(\\Z_{p^2}\\) or \\(\\Z_p \\times \\Z_p\\). We first prove that all finite \\(p\\)-groups have a non-trivial centre (that is, the centre must contain more than one element).\n\nLemma 6.2 A finite \\(p\\)-group \\(G\\) of order \\(p^r\\) has a non-trivial centre.\n\n\nProof. \n\nConsider the class equation for \\(G\\): \\[|G| = |Z(G)| + \\sum_{t+1}^{r}|C_i|.\\] Now \\(p\\) divides the order of \\(G\\) and \\(p\\) also divides \\(\\sum_{t+1}^{r}|C_i|\\). It follows that \\(p\\) must divide \\(|Z(G)|\\). Therefore \\(|Z(G)|\\) is at least \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nLemma 6.3 Let \\(G\\) be a non-abelian group. Then \\(G/Z(G)\\) is non-cyclic.\n\n\nProof. \n\nSuppose \\(G/Z(G)\\) is cyclic. This means there is an element \\(g \\in G\\) such that \\[\\{g^i Z(G): i \\in \\Z\\} = G/Z(G)\\] that is, the element \\(gZ(G)\\) generates all of \\(G/Z(G)\\). This now means that every element of \\(G\\) can be written in the form \\(g^{i}z\\) for some \\(i \\in \\Z\\) and \\(z \\in Z(G)\\). Now let \\(h_1,h_2 \\in G\\). There are \\(i,j \\in \\Z\\) and \\(z_1,z_2 \\in Z(G)\\) such that \\(h_1 = g^{i}z_1 =\\) and \\(h_2 = g^j{z_2}\\). We have: \\[\\begin{align*}\nh_1h_2 &= g^{i}z_1g^j{z_2} = g^{i}g^{j}z_1z_2 = g^{j}g^{i}z_1z_2\\\\\n&= g^{j}g^{i}z_2z_1 = g^{j}z_2g^{i}z_1 = h_2 h_1.\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, for all \\(h_1,h_2 \\in G\\) \\(h_1 h_2 = h_2 h_1\\) and \\(G\\) is abelian. This yields the desired contradiction.\n\n\n\nTheorem 6.1 A group \\(G\\) of order \\(p^2\\), where \\(p\\) is prime, is necessarily abelian.\n\n\nProof. \n\nBy Lemma 6.2, \\(p\\) divides the order of \\(|Z(G)|\\). Therefore the order of \\(Z(G)\\) is either \\(p\\) or \\(p^2\\). If \\(|Z(G)| = p^2\\), then \\(G=Z(G)\\) and \\(G\\) is therefore abelian. We may therefore assume that \\(|Z(G)| = p\\).\nNow observe that if \\(|Z(G)| = p\\), then \\(|G/Z(G)| = p^2/p = p\\). Recall that groups of prime order are always cyclic and, hence, abelian. Therefore \\(G/Z(G)\\) is abelian. Lemma 6.3 now implies that \\(G\\) must be abelian.\n\n\n\nFor any prime \\(p\\), there are exactly two isomorphically distinct groups, \\(\\Z_{p^2}\\) and \\(\\Z_p \\times \\Z_p\\), of order \\(p^2\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nThe result follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups and the fact that for any prime, \\(p\\), \\(\\Z_p \\times \\Z_p\\) is abelian as is \\(\\Z_{p^2}\\) by the above theorem.\n\n\n\nExample 6.4  \n\nThe only groups of order\n\n4 are \\(\\Z_4\\) and \\(\\Z_2 \\times \\Z_2\\);\n9 are \\(\\Z_9\\) and \\(\\Z_3 \\times \\Z_3\\);\n10,201 are \\(\\Z_{10201}\\) and \\(\\Z_{101}\\times \\Z_{101}\\).\n\n\n\nBut what about groups of order \\(p^3\\)?\n\nLet us consider first groups of order \\(8 = 2^3\\). There are two non-abelian groups of order \\(8\\): \\(D_4\\) and \\(Q_8\\). This means that we need a little more than Theorem 6.1 to classify groups of order \\(p^3\\).\nNotice that every non-abelian group \\(G\\) of order \\(p^3\\) must have a centre of order \\(p\\). This follows since if \\(|Z(G)| = p^2\\), then \\(G/Z(G)\\) has order \\(p\\) and so, by Lemma 6.2, \\(G\\) must be abelian which would be a contradiction.\nNow if \\(Z(G)\\) has order \\(p\\), then \\(G/Z(G)\\) has order \\(p^2\\) and so is abelian.\n\n\nExample 6.5  \n\nBoth non-abelian groups of order \\(8\\) have centres of order \\(2\\). The centre of \\(D_4\\) is \\(\\{e, r_2\\}\\), while the centre of \\(Q_8\\) is \\(\\{1,-1\\}\\). (Recall that \\(Q_8 = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\} )\\).",

    "text": "6.3 Centralisers and Sylow’s First Theorem\nIn Lemma 6.1 we showed that a group acts on its own elements by conjugation (that is, conjugation is a group action). Whenever we have a group action we have orbits and stabilizers; the orbits of this action are what we have called the conjugacy classes of the group, but what about the stabilizers?\n\nDefinition 6.3 (Centraliser) Let \\(x\\) be an element from a group \\(G\\). The centraliser of \\(x\\) in \\(G\\) is denoted and defined by \\[cent_G(x) = \\{ g \\in G \\, | \\, gxg^{-1} = x \\} = \\{ g \\in G \\, | \\, gx = xg \\}.\\]\n\nSo, the centraliser of \\(x\\) in \\(G\\) consists of all of the elements of \\(G\\) that commute with \\(x\\). Notice that \\(cent_G(x) = G\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is in the centre of \\(G\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nDo NOT confuse the centre of a group with the centraliser of an element.\nIf \\(G\\) is abelian, \\(\\centg(x) = G\\) for all \\(x \\in G\\). However, for non-abelian group, this only happens when \\(x\\) is in the centre of \\(G\\). For example, in \\(D_3\\): \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\centg(e) &= D_3 \\\\\n\\centg(r_1) &= \\{e,r_1,r_2\\}=\\centg(r_2) \\\\\n\\centg(s_1) &= \\{e, s_1\\} \\\\\n\\centg(s_2) &= \\{e,s_2\\} \\\\\n\\centg(s_3) &= \\{e, s_3\\}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\nLemma 6.4 Let \\(x\\) be an element from a group \\(G\\). Then \\(cent_G(x)\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nWe give a direct and indirect proof.\n\nIndirect proof: The \\(\\centg(x)\\) is the stabiliser of \\(x\\) under the action of \\(G\\) on itself by conjugation. By Theorem 3.2, \\(\\centg(x)\\) is therefore a subgroup of \\(G\\).\nDirect proof: we carry out the subgroup checks.\n\nClearly \\(e \\in \\centg(x)\\) since \\(ex = xe\\).\nLet \\(g,h \\in \\centg(x)\\). Then \\[ghx = gxh = xgh\\] and so \\(gh \\in \\centg(x)\\).\nLet \\(g \\in \\centg(x)\\). Then \\(gx = xg\\). Post and pre-multiplying by \\(\\ginv\\) we have: \\[x\\ginv =  \\ginv g x \\ginv = \\ginv x g \\ginv = \\ginv x\\] and so \\(\\ginv \\in \\centg(x)\\). This complete the subgroup checks and so \\(\\centg(x)\\) is a group.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.6  \n\nThe conjugacy classes in \\(D_3\\) are \\(\\{e\\}\\), \\(\\{r_1,r_2\\}\\) and \\(\\{s_1,s_2,s_3\\}\\). Notice the following: \\[\\begin{align*}\n|\\centg(e)|\\times |\\conjg(e)| &= |D_3| \\times |\\{e\\}| = 6 \\\\\n|\\centg(r_1)|\\times |\\conjg(r_1)| &= |\\{e,r_1,r_2\\}| \\times |\\{r_1,r_2\\}| = 6 \\\\\n|\\centg(s_i)|\\times |\\conjg(s_i)| &= |\\{e,s_i\\}| \\times |\\{s_1,s_2,s_3\\}| = 6.\n\\end{align*}\\] This is not a coincidence, merely an application of the Orbit-Stabiliser Theorem (Theorem 3.3) applied to the conjugation action of: \\[ |\\stab(x)| \\times |\\orb(x)| = |G|.\\] Under the conjugacy action, \\(\\stab(x) = \\centg(x)\\) and \\(\\conjg(x) = \\orb(x)\\).\n\n\nWe are now in a position to state and prove Sylow’s First Theorem.\n\nTheorem 6.2 (Sylow’s First Theorem) Let G be a finite group of order \\(p^{\\alpha}s\\), where \\(p\\) is a prime not dividing \\(s\\). Then \\(G\\) has a subgroup of order \\(p^{\\beta}\\) for each integer \\(\\beta\\) such that \\(0 \\leq \\beta \\leq \\alpha\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nWe prove this result by induction on the order of \\(G\\).\nOur base case occurs when \\(|G| = 1\\). In this case the result is readily seen to hold.\nNext assume that that \\(|G| = p^{\\alpha}s\\) (for a prime \\(p\\) and \\(\\gcd(s,p) = 1\\)) and the result holds for all groups of order strictly less than \\(p^{\\alpha}s\\). The aim is to get to a point in which we can apply the inductive step. Our key tool is the Class equation Definition 6.2: \\[|G| = |Z(G)| + \\sum_{i=t+1}^r  |C_i|.\\]\nThere are two cases to consider: either \\(p\\) does not divide \\(|C_i|\\) for some \\(i\\) or for any \\(i\\) between \\(t+1\\) and \\(r\\), \\(p\\) divides \\(|C_i|\\). We consider the first case first.\n\nCase 1: : Let \\(i\\) be such that \\(p\\) does not divide \\(|C_i|\\) and let \\(x \\in C_i\\). By the Orbit-Stabiliser Theorem \\(|C_i| \\times |\\centg(x)| = |G|\\). Therefore \\(p^{\\alpha}\\) divides \\(|\\centg(x)|\\) since \\(p^{\\alpha}\\) does not divide \\(|C_i|\\). Notice moreover that since \\(x \\notin \\Z(G)\\), \\(\\centg(x) \\ne G\\) and so \\(|\\centg(x)|&lt; |G|\\). Therefore we may apply the inductive hypothesis to conclude the the result holds for \\(\\centg(x)\\). Since \\(\\centg(x) &lt; G\\), then the result holds in \\(G\\) as well.\nCase 2: In this case \\(p\\) divides the order of \\(\\Z(G)\\), since \\(p\\) divides \\(|C_i\\) for all \\(i\\) and \\(p\\) divides \\(|G|\\). We may now apply Cauchy’s Theorem ( Theorem 3.5) to conclude that \\(\\Z(G)\\) has a subgroup \\(N\\) of order \\(p\\). Notice that as \\(N \\le Z(G)\\), then \\(N\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) (\\(g n \\ginv = n\\) for all \\(g \\in G\\) and \\(n \\in N\\)). Now as \\(G/N\\) has order \\(p^{\\alpha -1}s\\) we may therefore apply the induction hypothesis to \\(G/N\\). Let \\(\\beta\\) be a number between \\(0\\) and \\(\\alpha -2\\). By induction \\(G/N\\) has a subgroup of order \\(p^{\\beta}\\). Applying the correspondence theorem (Theorem 4.5), there is therefore a subgroup \\(H \\le G\\) such that \\(H/N\\) is a subgroup of \\(G/N\\) of order \\(p^{\\beta}\\). Now observe that \\(H\\) must have have order \\(p^{\\beta +1}\\) since, if \\(H/N = \\{N, h_2N, \\ldots, h_{p^{\\beta}}N \\}\\), then \\[H =  N \\sqcup h_2N \\sqcup \\ldots \\sqcup h_{p^{\\beta}}N\\] has order \\(p^{\\beta +1}\\). Therefore, for all \\(i\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(\\alpha\\), \\(G\\) has a subgroup of order \\(p^{i}\\) (the trivial subgroup \\(\\{e\\}\\) of \\(G\\) is a subgroup of order \\(1\\).)\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 6.4 (Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup) Let \\(G\\) be a finite group of order \\(p^{\\alpha}s\\), where \\(p\\) is a prime not dividing \\(s\\). A subgroup of \\(G\\) of order \\(p^{\\alpha}\\) is called a Sylow p-subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\n\nExample 6.7  \n\nWe consider some groups we have already encountered:\n\n\\(|D_3| = 2 \\times 3\\). The Sylow-2 subgroups are \\(\\{e, s_i\\}\\), \\(i=1,2,3\\). The only Sylow-3 subgroup is \\(\\{e, r_1, r_2\\}\\).\n\\(|A_4| = 12 = 4 \\times 3\\). Thus \\(A_4\\) has Sylow 3-subgroups of order \\(3\\) (each generated by a three-cycle) and a Sylow 2-subgroup of order \\(4\\) namely \\(\\{\\id, (1 \\; 2) (3 \\; 4),(1 \\; 3)(2 \\; 4),(1 \\; 4)(2 \\;3) \\}\\).\n\n\n\nThe notion of conjugacy can be extended to subsets of a group \\(G\\), though in practice only subgroups are of importance.\n\nDefinition 6.5 Let \\(H\\) be a subgroup of a group \\(G\\), and \\(g \\in G\\). The subset \\(gHg^{-1} = \\{ ghg^{-1} \\, | \\, h \\in H \\}\\) is called the conjugate of \\(H\\) by \\(g\\).\n\nWe have seen this idea before when we proved Theorem 4.6 using group actions, and needed the fact that if \\(H\\) is a subgroup then \\(gHg^{-1}\\) is a subgroup. The following Lemma tells us even more.\n\nLemma 6.5 Let \\(H\\) be a subgroup of a group \\(G\\) and \\(g \\in G\\). Then \\(gHg^{-1}\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) isomorphic to \\(H\\).\n\n\nProof. \n\nFirst we show that \\(gH\\ginv\\) is a subgroup.\nClearly, \\(e \\in g H \\ginv\\) since \\(g e \\ginv = e\\).\nLet \\(h_1,h_2 \\in H\\). Then\n\\[gh_1\\ginv g h_2 \\ginv = gh_1 h_2 \\ginv \\in gH\\ginv.\\] Therefore \\(gH\\ginv\\) is closed under products.\nLastly let \\(h \\in H\\), then \\[(gh\\ginv)^{-1} = g h^{-1}\\ginv \\in gH \\ginv\\] and so \\(gh\\ginv\\) is closed under inverses.\nThe map \\(\\phi: H \\to gH\\ginv\\) by \\(h \\mapsto gh\\ginv\\) is an isomorphism.\nClearly \\(\\phi\\) is surjective. To see that is is injective observe that if \\[gh_1\\ginv = gh_2 \\ginv\\] then, post-multiplying by \\(g\\) and pre-multiplying by \\(\\ginv\\) we have: \\[h_1 = \\ginv g h_1 \\ginv g = \\ginv g h_2 \\ginv g = h_2.\\] Therefore \\(\\phi\\) is a bijection.\nTo verify that \\(\\phi\\) is a homomorphism, observe \\[\\phi(h_1h_2) = gh_1h_2 \\ginv = gh_1 \\ginv gh_2 \\ginv = \\phi(h_1)\\phi(h_2)\\] as required.\n\n\nThere is an immediate connection between conjugacy and normal subgroups; \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) if and only if for all \\(g \\in G, \\; gH = Hg\\), but \\(gH = Hg \\ifif gHg^{-1} = H\\). It follows that \\(H\\) is normal in \\(G\\) if and only if \\(H\\) has no distinct conjugates in \\(G\\), that is we only get \\(H\\). Note that if \\(H\\) is any subgroup of \\(G\\) then if \\(H\\) is normal in \\(G\\) we have that \\(gHg^{-1}=H \\; \\forall g \\in G\\); if \\(H\\) is not normal in \\(G\\) then \\(\\exists \\, x \\in G\\) such that \\(xHx^{-1} \\neq H\\) but \\(xHx^{-1}\\) is still a subgroup of \\(G\\).\nWe can now state the remaining Sylow Theorems.\n\nTheorem 6.3 (Sylow’s Second Theorem) Let \\(H_1\\) and \\(H_2\\) be Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups of a finite group \\(G\\). Then \\(H_1\\) and \\(H_2\\) are conjugate.\n\nThat is, there exists \\(x \\in G\\) such that \\(xH_1x^{-1}=H_2\\) and vice versa.\n\nTheorem 6.4 (Sylow’s Third Theorem) The number of Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups of a finite group \\(G\\) is congruent to 1 modulo \\(p\\) and divides \\(|G|\\).\n\nWe now consider an application.\n\nLet \\(G\\) be a group of order \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\). By Cauchy’s Theorem \\(G\\) has at least one subgroup of order \\(3\\) and at least one of order \\(5\\).\nLet \\(n_3\\) be the number of subgroups of order \\(3\\). By Sylow’s Third Theorem \\(n_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\) and divides the order of \\(G\\) which is \\(15\\). Therefore \\(n_3\\) must be \\(1\\) since \\(5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\). Therefore \\(G\\) has a unique Sylow \\(3\\)-subgroup, \\(N_1\\). By Sylow’s Second Theorem, \\(N_1\\) must be normal in \\(G\\) since it is conjugate only to itself.\nIn a similar way \\(G\\) has a normal subgroup \\(N_2\\) of order \\(5\\). Notice that \\(N_1 \\cap N_2 = \\{e\\}\\) since every non-trivial element of \\(N_1\\) has order \\(3\\) and every non-trivial element of order \\(N_2\\) has order \\(5\\).\nLet \\(a\\) be a non-trivial element of \\(N_1\\) and \\(b\\) be a non-trivial element of \\(N_2\\) and consider the product \\(ab\\). Now \\(ab\\) has order \\(1,3, 5\\) or \\(15\\).\nIf the order of \\(ab =1\\), then \\(ab = e\\) and so \\(b = a^{-1}\\) which contradicts the fact that \\(N_1 \\cap N_2 = \\{e\\}\\).\nIf the order of \\(ab = 3\\), then \\(\\gen{ab}\\) must be \\(N_1\\) (since \\(H_1\\) is the only Sylow \\(3\\)-subgroup of \\(G\\)). This means that \\(ab = n \\in N_1\\) and so \\(b = a^{-1}n \\in N_1\\) which contradicts the fact that \\(N_1 \\cap N_2 = \\{e\\}\\).\nIf the order of \\(ab = 5\\), then as in the previous case \\(ab \\in N_2\\) and \\(a = mb^{-1}\\) for some \\(m \\in N_2\\) and so \\(a \\in N_2\\) yielding a contradiction.\nWe must therefore conclude that \\(ab\\) has order \\(15\\) and so \\(G\\) is a cyclic group.\nNote that the above does not generalise to groups of order \\(pq\\), for distinct primes \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) since there are non-abelian groups of order \\(pq\\) (e.g . \\(D_p\\) for every prime \\(p\\) is a non-abelian group of order \\(2p\\)). In the case where a group \\(G\\) of order \\(p,q\\) has a unique Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup and a unique Sylow \\(q\\)-subgroup, the argument above does generalise.\nLet us suppose that \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct primes with \\(q&lt;p\\) and consider a group \\(G\\) or order \\(pq\\).\nThere is always a unique Sylow \\(p\\) subgroup, since \\(n_p\\), the number of Sylow \\(p\\) subgroups must divide \\(pq\\) and be congruent to \\(1\\) modulo \\(p\\) i.e. \\(n_p\\) divides \\(q\\) and is congruent to \\(1\\) modulo \\(p\\). As an example, consider \\(D_3\\). This has order \\(2\\times 3\\) and a unique (and so normal) Sylow \\(3\\)-subgroup \\(\\{e,r_1,r_2\\}\\).\nWhat about \\(n_q\\) the number of Sylow \\(q\\)-subgroups of \\(G\\)? We know that \\(n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q\\) and \\(n_q\\) divides \\(pq\\). This means that \\(n_q\\) is either \\(1\\) or \\(p\\). If \\(p\\) is not congruent to \\(1\\) modulo \\(q\\), then \\(n_q = 1\\) and \\(G\\) is cyclic.\nIf on the other hand \\(p \\equiv 1 \\pmod q\\), then \\(n_q\\) might be equal to \\(p\\). For example if we consider the \\(D_p\\), here \\(q=2\\), then \\(D_p\\) has \\(p\\) Sylow \\(2\\)-subgroups: \\(\\{e, s_i\\}\\), \\(i=1,2,\\ldots, p\\).\nWe can summarise the above as follows:\nLet \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) be distinct primes with \\(q&lt;p\\) and \\(p \\not \\equiv 1 \\pmod q\\). Then a group \\(G\\) of order \\(pq\\) is cyclic.\nApplying this to groups of order \\(n = pq\\) for small \\(n\\) we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}\nn & q & p & \\\\\n\\hline\n15 & 3 & 5& \\text{cyclic only }\\\\\n21 & 3 & 7& \\text{possibly non-cyclic }\\\\\n33 & 3 & 11 & \\text{cyclic only } \\\\\n35 & 5 & 7& \\text{cyclic only }\\\\\n55 & 5 & 11& \\text{possibly non-cyclic}\\\\\n77 & 7 & 11& \\text{cyclic only }\\\\\n91 & 7 & 13& \\text{cyclic only }\\\\\n119 & 7 & 17& \\text{cyclic only }\n\\end{array}\n\\]",

These conditions are only satisfied for \\(n_7 = 1\\), hence the subgroup is unique and so normal in \\(G\\). Denote this subgroup \\(N\\). Then we can factor \\(G\\) by \\(N\\) (as \\(N\\) is normal) and \\(|G/N| = 9\\) which means that \\(G/N\\) is isomorphic to either \\(\\Z_9\\) or \\(\\Z_3 \\times \\Z_3\\) (recall the result of Theorem 7.1).

If \\(n_p = q\\) then \\(1 + kp = q \\imp q-1\\) is a multiple of \\(p\\) and this is not allowed. Hence we have that \\(n_p = n_q = 1\\) and, therefore, both Sylow subgroups are normal.\nNote that \\(x \\in H\\) and so \\(\\xinv \\in H\\). Also, \\(H\\) is normal in \\(G\\) and so for all \\(y \\in G\\) we have that \\(y\\xinv \\yinv \\in H\\). Hence, since \\(H\\) is closed, \\(x(y \\xinv \\yinv) \\in H\\). Similarly, \\(y, \\yinv \\in K\\) and K is normal in \\(G\\), so for all \\(x \\in G\\) we have \\((xy\\xinv) \\in K\\) and, hence \\((xy\\xinv)\\yinv \\in K\\).\nSince all non-identity elements of \\(H\\) have order \\(p\\) and all non-identity elements of \\(K\\) have order \\(q\\) then it follows that \\(H \\cap K = \\{e\\}\\). But in (c) above we showed that \\(xy\\xinv \\yinv \\in H\\) and \\(xy\\xinv \\yinv \\in K\\), so \\(xy\\xinv \\yinv \\in H \\cap K\\). Hence \\(xy\\xinv \\yinv = e\\) and so \\[xy = (\\xinv \\yinv)^{-1} = (\\yinv)^{-1}(\\xinv)^{-1} = yx.\\]\nWe know that \\(xy\\) has order \\(1, p, q\\) or \\(pq\\). We also know that \\(H \\cap K = \\{e\\}\\). If \\(xy\\) has order 1 then \\(x = \\yinv \\in K\\). This is a contradiction as \\(x \\notin K\\) since it has order \\(p\\). If \\(xy\\) has order \\(p\\) then \\(xy \\in H\\) and so \\(xy = x^i\\) for some \\(i \\in \\Z\\). Then \\(y = x^{i-1} \\in H\\) which is a contradiction since \\(y \\notin H\\). If \\(xy\\) has order \\(q\\) then, similarly, \\(x \\in K\\) which is a contradiction. It then follows that \\(xy\\) has order \\(pq\\) and, since that is the order of \\(G\\), then \\(G\\) must be cyclic.",
