The deadline is Friday 21 February at 3pm.\nAssignment 2(15%): Released Thursday 20 March. The deadline is Friday 28 March at 3pm.\n\nAssignments will be released on MyAberdeen and you should submit your solutions as a pdf file on MyAberdeen by the due date. Only in exceptional circumstances will work handed in after the due date be accepted for formal assessment.\n\n\nIndividual work\nYour submission for Continuous Assessment must be your own individual work unless stated otherwise. Further information and a reference to the University Code of Conduct on Student Discipline can be found in the Information Booklet.\nYou are encouraged to discuss exercises for this course with other students, for example in small groups. You may shop around for ideas but it is expected that you possess and use your own critical faculties, to write up your own solutions. You must not copy sentences from fellow students. If you do not understand the solution of another student, do not attempt to use it as your own solution.\n\n\nFormative assessment\nAt the end of each chapter in the notes, you will find problem sheets with questions addressing the content covered in that chapter. Although these sheets do not contribute to the continuous assessment component, you are strongly encouraged to attempt them as they are designed to consolidate your understanding and enhance your problem-solving skills. Full solutions are provided and will appear after the sheet or sheets have been covered in example classes.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThe final exam will be during Exam Week and comprises 70% of the module mark. It is an unseen, closed-book examination. The examination will require you to state definitions, state (and possibly prove) results, and apply these to solving problems. You should be able to state every definition and result in the module unless they are marked in the lecture notes as non-examinable.\n\n\nResits\nResit In the summer there will be a resit examination consisting of a single two-hour exam paper. The CGS mark awarded for the resit will be the maximum of\n\nthe mark obtained by using the resit examination result combined with the carried-forward CA mark as in the original diet and\nthe mark based on the resit examination performance alone.\n\n\n\nCalculators in exams\nCalculators will not be allowed in the main examination or the resit examination.",

Identifying \\(x\\) with \\((x,0)\\) and \\(y\\) with \\((y,0)\\). We calculate \\[iy = (0,1)\\cdot(y,0) =(0 - 0,0 +y)=(0,y).\\] Consequently, \\[x + iy = (x,0) + (0,y) = (x,y) = z.\\]\nTo see that \\(i^2 = -1\\), we calculate \\[(0,1)(0,1) = (0-1,0+0)= (-1,0).\\] This yields the desired conclusion under the identification \\(-1 = (-1,0)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.2\n\n\nHow many real solutions \\(x\\) does \\(x^2+1=0\\) have? Show that the polynomial equation \\(z^2+1=0\\) has exactly two solutions \\(z\\in\\C.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.2\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.2\n\n\nThis equation has no reals solutions. To find all solutions in \\(\\C\\), we first rearrange to get \\(z^2 = -1\\). This means that \\(z\\) must be one of the square roots of \\(-1\\). There are at least two ways to find all possible values of \\(z\\).\nThe first approach uses Proposition 1.7.\nExpressing \\(-1\\) in polar form, we have \\(-1 = e^{i\\pi}\\).\nBy Proposition 1.7 the square roots of \\(-1\\), are \\[ e^{\\frac{i(\\pi+ 2k\\pi)}{2}}\\] for \\(k = 0,1\\). This gives exactly two solutions: \\[i = e^{\\frac{i(\\pi)}{2}}, \\text{ and } -i = e^{\\frac{i(\\pi+ 2\\pi)}{2}}.\\]\nThe other approach is as follows. Write \\(z = x+iy\\). Then, \\[z^2 = (x+iy)(x+iy) = (x^2-y^2) + i(2xy) = -1.\\] This gives us two equations \\[\\begin{align}\nx^2 -y^2 &= -1 \\\\\n2xy &= 0.\n\\end{align}\\] The second equation imples one of \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) is \\(0\\).\nIf \\(x\\) is \\(0\\), then \\(-y^2 = -1\\) and so \\(y= \\pm 1\\).\nIf \\(y\\) is \\(0\\), then \\(x^2 = -1\\) and has no solutions (since \\(x\\) is a real number).\nWe conclude that \\(x =0\\) and \\(y = \\pm 1\\), which gives exactly two values for \\(z\\), \\(i\\) and \\(-i\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.3\n\n\nGive examples of complex numbers \\(z,w\\neq0\\) such that \\(z^2+w^2=0.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.3\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.3\n\n\nTake \\(z=1,\\) \\(w=i.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.4\n\n\nSketch the position of the complex numbers \\(i, 1+i, \\frac{3+2i}{4}\\) in the plane.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.4\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.5\n\n\nExpress the following complex numbers \\(z\\) in the form \\(x+iy\\) with \\(x,y\\in\\R.\\) \\[(1+i)^{20},\\ (5+3i)(1+2i),\\ (1-i)(2+3i),\\ (1-i)i(1+i),\\ \\frac{2+i}{1-i}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.5\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.5\n\n\n\\[ (2i)^{10} = -1024,\\ -1+13i,\\ 5 +i,\\ 2i,\\ \\frac{1+3i}{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.6\n\n\nExpress the following complex numbers \\(z\\) in the form \\(x+iy\\) with \\(x,y\\in\\R.\\) \\[1/i,\\ \\frac{1}{1+i},\\ \\frac{3+i}{3-i}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.6\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.6\n\n\n\\[-i,\\ \\frac{1-i}{2},\\frac{8 + 6i}{10}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.7\n\n\nFind the modulus and the conjugate of the following complex numbers. \\[2+i,\\ i,\\ 5-3i,\\ \\frac{1+i}{2+i}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.7\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.7\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n|2+i| &= \\sqrt{5}, &  \\ol {2+i} = 2-i \\\\\n|5-3i| &= \\sqrt{34}, & \\ol {5-3i} = 5+3i \\\\\n|\\frac{1+i}{2+i}| &= \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{5}, & \\ol {\\frac{1+i}{2+i}} = \\frac{1-i}{2-i}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.8\n\n\nDescribe the sets \\(A=\\{z\\in\\C\\mid\\Im(z)&gt;0\\},\\) \\(B=\\{z\\in\\C\\mid\\Re(z)\\leqslant1\\},\\) \\(C=\\{z\\in\\C\\mid \\Re((1+i)z)=0\\},\\) and \\(A\\cap B\\) geometrically.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.8\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.8\n\n\n\nThe set \\(A\\) is the ‘upper half-plane’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set \\(B\\) is the “left half-plane” shifted to the right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set \\(C\\) is the straight line \\(x = y\\) since \\(\\Re((1+i)z) = x-y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is pictured below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.9\n\n\nDescribe the set \\(D=\\{z\\in\\C \\mid z\\cdot\\overline{z}=1\\}\\) geometrically.\nHint: Write \\(z=re^{i\\th}\\) in polar form.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.9\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1.9\n\n\nNote that \\(z \\cdot \\ol z = |z|^2\\).

We will now discuss some alternatives.\nA useful way to picture a complex function is to sketch its values on a grid \\(G.\\) The image grid \\(f(G)\\) is a distorted version of the original grid which can be navigated easily using the grid lines.

    "text": "Questions for further discussion\nIn this section we explain that most of the facts about limits, series, and continuity carry over from real analysis essentially without change.\nThe modulus of complex numbers defines a distance \\(d(z,w)=|z-w|\\) on the plane (this is the usual Euclidean distance), which determines the following standard terminology for metric spaces.\nThe same argument as in real analysis shows that the limit \\(w\\) is unique and that every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence. The converse is also true by the completeness of real numbers.\nThe advantage of Cauchy sequences is that one does not need to know the value of the limit in advance.\nAs in real analysis, the Cauchy criterion implies that every absolutely convergent series is convergent. Absolutely convergent series may be rearranged and orders of summation may be exchanged.\nAlthough \\(\\iy\\notin\\C,\\) it will be convenient to define \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\iy}z_n=\\iy\\) to mean that the sequence \\((z_n)_{n\\in\\N}\\) eventually leaves every disk.

    "text": "The residue theorem can be used to compute integrals of functions that do not have an obvious primitive. For this, we first need to find a suitable holomorphic function and contour to which we can apply the residue theorem, which is guesswork. The original integral is often a part of this contour and one shows that the rest of contour integral tends to zero.\nWe give three examples that illustrate the general technique.\n\nExample 11.1  \n\nLet \\(f(z)=\\frac{1}{1+z^4},\\) which is holomorphic except for poles of order one at all points \\(\\ze^{1+2k},\\) \\(k=0,1,2,3,\\) where \\(\\ze=e^{i\\pi/4}.\\) For \\(R&gt;0\\) introduce the semi-circular contour \\(\\eta_R\\colon[0,\\pi]\\to\\C,\\) \\(\\eta_R(t)=Re^{it}\\) and let \\(\\ga_R\\) be the concatenation of \\(\\eta_R\\) with the real interval \\([-R,R],\\) parametrized as in Example 6.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residues are \\[\\Res_{\\ze^{1+2k}}(f)=\\frac{-\\ze^{1+2k}}{4}.\\]\nWhen \\(R&gt;1,\\) the only isolated singularities inside the contour are \\(\\ze, \\ze^3,\\) hence \\(W_\\ze(\\ga_R)=W_{\\ze^3}(\\ga_R)=1\\) (more formally, this holds by Example 10.3 and Proposition 10.2) and \\(W_{\\ze^5}(\\ga_R)=W_{\\ze^7}(\\ga_R)=0\\) (more formally, by Cauchy’s Theorem 7.1). By the residue Theorem 10.1, \\[\\int_{\\ga_R}f(z)dz=2\\pi i\\bigl[W_\\ze(\\ga_R)\\Res_\\ze(f)+W_{\\ze^3}(\\ga_R)\\Res_{\\ze^3}(f)\\bigr]=\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}\\]\nThe contour integral decomposes as \\[\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\int_{\\ga_R}f(z)dz=\\int_{\\eta_R}f(z)dz+\\int_{[-R,R]}f(z)dz\\]\nand we have \\[\\int_{-\\iy}^{+\\iy}f(z)dz=\\lim_{R\\to+\\iy}\\int_{[-R,R]}f(z)dz.\\]\nWe claim that \\(\\int_{\\eta_R}f(z)dz\\to0\\) as \\(R\\to+\\iy.\\) We have \\(L(\\eta_R)=\\pi R\\) and \\[|f(z)|=\\frac{1}{|z^4+1|}\\overset{}{\\leqslant}\\frac{1}{R^4-1}\\] where the inequality follows by Equation 1.7.\nHence Equation 6.7 implies \\(\\left|\\int_{\\eta_R}f(z)dz\\right|\\leqslant\\frac{\\pi R}{R^4-1},\\) which indeed tends to zero as \\(R\\to+\\iy.\\) Putting things together, we get \\[\\int_{-\\iy}^{+\\iy}\\frac{dx}{1+x^4}=\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\]\nMore generally, we can use the approach above to compute all integrals \\(\\int_{-\\iy}^{+\\iy}f(z)dz\\) of rational functions \\(f(z)=\\frac{p(z)}{q(z)}\\) with \\(\\deg(q)\\geqslant\\deg(p)+2\\) and \\(q(x)\\neq0\\) for all \\(x\\in\\R.\\)\n\n\nIntegrals made only of trigonometric functions can often be evaluated using the residue theorem and the following method.\n\nExample 11.2  \n\nIf \\(x\\in\\R,\\) then \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{z+1/z}{2},\\) \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{z-1/z}{2i}\\) for \\(z=e^{ix}.\\) Using this, we can change variables and use \\(dz=izdx\\) to rewrite \\[\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\frac{\\cos(x)^2}{\\sin(x)+2}dx=\\int_{\\6 D_1(0)}\\frac{(1+z^2)^2}{2z^2(z^2+4iz-1)}dz\\]\nas a contour integral, which is evaluated using the residue theorem. The singularities of \\(f(z)=\\frac{(1+z^2)^2}{2z^2(z^2+4iz-1)}=\\frac{(1+z^2)^2}{2z^2(z-z_+)(z-z_-)}\\) are at \\(z=0\\) (pole of order two) and \\(z_\\pm=-i(2\\pm\\sqrt{3})\\) (poles of order one). Using Proposition 10.1(c), we find that the residues are \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\Res_0(f)&=\\lim_{z\\to0}\\frac{d}{dz}\\frac{(1+z^2)^2}{2(z^2+4iz-1)}=-2i,\\\\\n\\Res_{z_-}(f)&=\\lim_{z\\to z_-}\\frac{(1+z^2)^2}{2z^2(z-z_+)}=\\frac{(1+z_-^2)^2}{2z_-^2(z_--z_+)}=i\\sqrt{3}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Now the residue theorem implies \\[\\int_{\\6 D_1(0)}\\frac{(1+z^2)^2}{2z^2(z^2+4iz-1)}dz=2\\pi i(-2i+i\\sqrt{3})=2\\pi(\\sqrt{3}-2).\\]\nThis example can be generalized to compute integrals over \\([0,2\\pi]\\) of rational algebraic functions of \\(\\sin(x)\\) and \\(\\cos(x).\\)\n\n\nThe following integral was already computed in calculus using polar coordinates in the plane.\n\nExample 11.3  \n\n\\(\\int_{-\\iy}^{+\\iy} e^{-x^2}dx=\\sqrt{\\pi}\\)\nLet \\(a=(1+i)\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}.\\) Then \\(a^2=i\\pi.\\) The function \\(f(z)=\\frac{e^{-z^2}}{1+e^{-2az}}\\) is holomorphic except for poles of order one at all points \\(a\\left(k+\\frac12\\right),\\) \\(k\\in\\Z\\) (simple zeros of the denominator). Using the power series expansion of the exponential, we find \\[\\begin{align*}\n1+e^{-2az}&=1+e^{-2a\\left(z-\\frac{a}{2}\\right)}e^{a^2}=1-e^{-2a\\left(z-\\frac{a}{2}\\right)}\\\\\n&=2a\\left(z-\\frac{a}{2}\\right)-\\frac{1}{2!}4a^2\\left(z-\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2+\\ldots\n\\end{align*}\\] and this gives the residue \\[\\Res_{a/2}(f) = \\lim_{z\\to a/2}\\frac{e^{-z^2}(z-\\frac{a}{2})}{1+e^{-2az}}=\\frac{e^{-a^2/4}}{2a}=\\frac{-i}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}.\\]\nFrom \\(a^2=i\\pi\\) it is not hard to check \\[f(z)-f(z+a)=e^{-z^2}.\\]\nHence the integral over \\(z\\in[-\\iy,+\\iy]\\) can be computed using the two horizontal parts of the following contour \\(\\ga_R\\) as \\(R\\to+\\iy.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only singularity inside the contour is \\(a/2,\\) so the residue theorem gives \\[\\int_{\\ga_R} f(z)dz=2\\pi i\\frac{-i}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}=\\sqrt{\\pi}.\\]\nThe contour integral over \\(\\ga_R\\) splits into four parts. We estimate the vertical parts \\(\\eta_{\\pm R}\\) of the integral as follows. Let \\(z=x+iy\\) with \\(x=\\pm R\\) and \\(y\\in[0,\\sqrt{\\pi/2}].\\) Then \\[|f(z)|\\leqslant\\frac{e^{-\\Re(z^2)}}{1-e^{-\\Re(2 az)}}=\\frac{e^{y^2-x^2}}{1-e^{\\sqrt{2\\pi}(y-x)}}\\leqslant\\frac{e^{\\pi/2-x^2}}{1-e^{-\\sqrt{2\\pi}x}}\\]\ntends to zero as \\(|x|\\to+\\iy,\\) uniformly in \\(y\\in[0,\\sqrt{\\pi/2}].\\) Hence Equation 6.7 implies \\[\\int_{\\eta_{\\pm R}} f(z)dz\\xrightarrow{R\\to\\iy}0\\]\nand we conclude \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{\\pi}&=\\int_{\\ga_R} f(z)dz\\\\\n&=\\int_{-R}^{+R} f(z)dz+\\int_{R}^{-R} f(z+a)dz+\\int_{\\eta_{R}} f(z)dz+\\int_{\\eta_{-R}} f(z)dz\\\\\n&\\xrightarrow{R\\to+\\iy}\\int_{-\\iy}^{+\\iy} f(z)dz-\\int_{-\\iy}^{+\\iy} f(z+a)dz=\\int_{-\\iy}^{+\\iy} e^{-x^2}dx.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nDowson, H.
