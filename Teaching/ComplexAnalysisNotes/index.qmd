Below are two versions of the notes for MX4557 Complex Analysis. Both versions include the module handbook and all tutorial materials for the course:

Complete Notes: 
Gapped Notes: 


+   [Complete Notes](./CompleteNotes/index.html) <br>
    This version contains the full set of notes and will be updated throughout the semester to include solutions to problem sheets and correct any typos.
+   [Gapped Notes](./GappedNotes/index.html)
    <br> This version includes notes with gaps in the content, which I will annotate during lectures. These notes will not be updated.
