In December 2018 I obtained my PhD in pure mathematics, funded by the [Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland](https://carnegie-trust.org/),  at the University of St Andrews under the supervision of [Dr. Collin Bleak](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/people/cb211/) and [Dr. Martyn Quick](https://martynquick.github.io/index.html). Since then  I have been a postdoctoral research fellow working in geometric and combinatorial group theory at the [Institute of Mathematics](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/mathematics/) at the University of Aberdeen (2018-2020);  an LMS Early Career Fellow and then an Associate Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of St Andrews (2020-2022). Over the course of the latter position, I attained Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy and while at the University of Aberdeen, I was one of only two members of staff in the Institute of Mathematics, nominated for a teaching excellence award.  Immediately prior to my current role, I held a lectureship in pure mathematics at [Keele University](https://www.keele.ac.uk/)
