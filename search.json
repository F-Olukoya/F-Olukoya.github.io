In particular, decision problems in groups, cellular automata and groups generated by automata.\n\n\n\n\n“He took his vorpal sword in hand:  Long time the manxome foe he sought– So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought.”\n\n– Lewis Carroll"

This was funded by the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland and was supervised by of Dr. Collin Bleak and Dr. Martyn Quick. Since then I have been a postdoctoral research fellow working in geometric and combinatorial group theory at the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Aberdeen (2018-2020); an LMS Early Career Fellow and then an Associate Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of St Andrews (2020-2022). Over the course of the latter position, I attained Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy and while at the University of Aberdeen, I was one of only two members of staff in the Institute of Mathematics, nominated for a teaching excellence award.\nImmediately prior to my current role, I held a lectureship in pure mathematics at Keele University\n\nYouTube channel\nI have a YouTube channel where I look at miscellaneous mathematics (and related) topics often emphasing, where possible, a non-western point of view. This is partly funder by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Open postdoctoral fellowship “The Higman-Thompson groups, their generalisations, and automorphisms of shift spaces.” Below is a sample video."

I hope also to include more personal content about my own mathematics journey\nI am happy to speak about this to high school and primary school students.
